<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Deep Romantic Chasm: Diaries, 1979-1981</h2><p>In this, the eighth volume of James Lees-Milne's diaries, he is engaging and readable as ever, mixing candour and an often malicious wit with generosity of spirit and sympathy for human frailty.<br>These diaries are unlike their predecessors in that they show Lees-Milne developing an overwhelming tendresse for a much younger man. As candid in writing about himself as about others, he records the doubt, happiness, guilt and other turbulence that accompany an emotion he did not expect to feel again. This is the first volume to be edited not by the diarist himself but his literary executor, the friend in question.<br>But it deals with much else besides love and its difficulties. He writes the biography of his friend Harold Nicolson, sometimes in the process worsting his publisher, the formidable Norah Smallwood of Chatto &amp; Windus. With Derek Hill (but without an importunate Bruce Chatwin) he twice visits Mount Athos, recording the delights and discomforts of a spiritual journey to the Holy Mountain. Both the man and his period are irresistably present in these pages, as one minute he is exasperated by Labour's 'winter of discontent', or predicts incineration by Soviet attack, and in the next recreates the values and friendships of an earlier, gentler age.</p><p>Also available by James Lees-Milne, new in paperback: &#34;A Mingled Measure: Diaries, 1953-1972&#34; (ISBN: 0719556090) 22.95 and &#34;Ancient as the Hills: Diaries 1973-1974&#34; (ISBN: 0719562007) 22.95.James Lees-Milne, who died in 1997, ran the National Trust&#39;s operation to rescue historic houses from 1936 to 1951. His prolific output as a writer includes many works on architecture and several biographies, along with the much-acclaimed memoirs Another Self, People and Places and Fourteen Friends. His eight other volumes of diaries, all rapturously received, are Ancestral Voices, Prophesying Peace, Caves of Ice, Midway on the Waves, A Mingled Measure, Ancient as the Hills, Holy Dread and Through Wood and Dale. Diana Mosley described the last as &#39;a comic masterpiece&#39;. Michael Bloch, the editor of this volume, was appointed by James Lees-Milne to be his literary executor, and is now writing his biography. He lives in London.</p><h2>The Michelin Man&#39;s First Hundred Years</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>My Village: Rhymes from Around the World</h2><p><i>My Village</i> is a beautiful collection featuring nursery rhymes and verses from around the world: New Zealand, China, Australia, Norway, Ireland, Tonga, Jamaica, Japan, Zimbabwe, Fiji, Indonesia, Denmark, Iran, Germany, Samoa, Switzerland, Russia, Brazil, France, Holland, Iceland, and India. Readers delight in quirky, touching, and funny verses from the 22 different countries, brought vividly to life by the appealingly fresh artwork from exciting young illustrator Mique Moriuchi, who captures each verse with a uniquely beautiful and child's-eye focus. Danielle Wright has included some familiar rhymes along with others that are less well known. Internationally acclaimed poet and former Children&#x2019;s Laureate Michael Rosen introduces the collection, discussing the origins of nursery rhymes as well as reviewing some of his favorites. Also endorsed by the International Youth Library, this book is an essential addition to any school or library.</p><p>Danielle Wright enjoyed teaching migrants English when gaining her CELTA and then worked with many different migrant organisations while writing speeches for Sir Barry Curtis (when he was the Mayor of Manukau). During this time, she was surprised to learn that there are over 165 different ethnic groups in Manukau alone! Danielle lives in Auckland, New Zealand.Mique Moriuchi lives in London, where she uses bits and pieces, textured paint and collage to create rich and unique pictures for children's books such as Granny Torelli Makes Soup by Sharon Creech and Talk Peace by Sam Williams. Mique Moriuchi has a (BA) Hons. in Graphic design from Norwich School of Art &amp; Design and an MA in sequential design and illustration from the University of Brighton. Michael Rosen is one of the best known figures in the children's book world and the British arts scene. He has written numerous award-winning poetry books, non-fiction and picture books. He is also a journalist, broadcaster and performer, who visits schools in the UK and abroad with his one-man show. He was Children's Laureate from 2007-9, using the post to be an "ambassador of fun". He supports Arsenal Football Club and lives in north London.Sunny, winsome art illustrates global sampling of nursery rhymes. The entries range from brief and descriptive, such as New Zealand&#x2019;s &#x201c;Big Whale&#x201d; (&#x201c;Swish your tail, whale / Spout your blowhole&#x201d;), to rhythmic and sensory, as in Norway&#x2019;s &#x201c;Rain&#x201d; (&#x201c;Zick, zack, / Hour after hour, / Tick, tack, / Shower after shower&#x201d;). A few selections, such as Denmark&#x2019;s narrative, droll &#x201c;Snowman Frost,&#x201d; may resonate more with children slightly older than the usual nursery-rhyme audience. Moriuchi&#x2019;s vibrantly hued, mixed-media illustrations shine with playful, textured scenes, rendered in paint and paper collage, of multicultural children and animals in diverse settings. Although each translated poem is also accompanied by text in the original language, the title lacks pronunciation guides, which could make for some awkward (or creative) read-alouds. Overall, though, children will enjoy the diverse views, in both text and visuals, of universal, child-friendly topics and activities, from kite flying to bathtime. Rosen&#x2019;s lively introduction provides more background about nursery rhymes, and the poems&#x2019; source notes are appended. Pair this with Floella Benjamin&#x2019;s Skip across the Ocean: Nursery Rhymes from around the World (1995). Preschool-Grade 2. --Shelle Rosenfeld</p><h2>One Minute</h2><p>In one minute, you can blink your eyes twenty times, hug your dog, plant seeds, say good-bye, watch the rain, or even save a life. So much can occur in this sliver of time&#x2014;one minute can feel like a singular experience. This poignant picture book is at once an introduction to time for young readers, an ode to living each moment with purpose, and a thoughtful exploration of how children experience one minute (may it seem short or long) playfully, profoundly, and with a boundless sense of possibility.</p><p>Somin Ahn is an author and illustrator based in Korea. This is her first book.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;At once charming and mildly troubling, this debut picture book from Korean author/illustrator Ahn explores the meaning of a minute through the experiences of a young girl. "Sometimes one minute is short (when your turn on the merry-go-round is over). Sometimes one minute is long (getting your tooth pulled)." While the story is conceptually solid and even endearing, there is a scene where the girl runs into the street to save her dog. "In one minute something can happen. Or something can be saved." This disturbing incident includes a screeching car and more than one oblivious passerby. What it lacks is a responsible adult or any consequences, turning this potential teachable moment into a simple close call. The tale ends with one of the most memorable minutes: when a new baby arrives home. Pencil and watercolor illustrations are childlike, sweet, and uncluttered yet are marred somewhat by the girl's skin tone, which varies inexplicably from chartreuse to bright yellow. VERDICT While this title might be fine in a classroom setting for a unit on time, it regrettably goes from recommended to additional in the minute it takes to read it.&#x2014;Teri Markson, Los Angeles Public Library</p><h2>Phase Space: Stories from the Manifold and Elsewhere</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

Whale, a British expatriate who made his way to Hollywood just as films were making the transition to the talkies, directed both the original <i>Frankenstein</i> (1931) and its sequel, <i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i> (1936), for Universal Pictures. Afraid of being pigeonholed as a horror director (he also made <i>The Invisible Man</i> and <i>The Old Dark House</i>), he eventually insisted on more mainstream projects, including the musical <i>Show Boat</i> and <i>The Road Back</i>, a sequel to <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> that flopped at the box office. Today, <i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i> is considered to be his best film, a work that combines moments of genuine suspense with a thoroughly macabre sense of humor.<p> In 1982, film historian James Curtis wrote his first biography of Whale. <i>James Whale: A New World of Gods and Monsters</i> is not a revision of that book, however, but a substantial reworking involving much in the way of new research. Whale's life story is emblematic of an entire generation of European �migr�s who made critical artistic contributions to American film only to find themselves in ultimate obscurity. Although recent fictional and truthful accounts of Whale's life have emphasized his homosexuality--even the jacket cover of this book cites it as the reason for Hollywood's eventual rejection of Whale--Curtis himself tells a more nuanced tale. Certainly, Whale made no attempts to hide his preference for men; at the same time, he made his sexual orientation neither a prominent feature of his personal life nor his movies. While it's possible that he was fired from Columbia Pictures in 1941 because of homophobia on the part of studio owner Harry Cohn, it should also be noted that it didn't take much to get on the bad side of Harry Cohn and that, perhaps more to the point, Whale hadn't had a significant commercial hit in five years.</p><p> Curtis's biography is filled with fascinating anecdotes from David Lewis, Whale's longtime companion, and several of the actors who worked with Whale, including Peter Cushing and Gloria (<i>Titanic</i>) Stuart. It also has a rich appreciation of the artistic qualities of Whale's work. It is, in short, the sort of critical biography that any film director would hope to have. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>In 1982, the late William K. Everson reviewed a little 267-page book I had written about the life of James Whale. At the time I thought it was pretty good, and so did Everson. "Probably there will be other books on Whale," Everson wrote, "including, I hope, one devoted primarily to the films themselves. But if one should come along to be the glossy equivalent of Whale's own <i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i>, then this initial book must be considered the parallel to Whale's original <i>Frankenstein</i>: flawed, rough-hewn, but still the basic work from which others must derive." I had no idea how prophetic Everson's words would be, for just as it eventually fell to Whale to improve upon his own original, so it was with me. In 1993, I decided I had not done justice to the subject of James Whale. I began researching his life all over again and rewriting it from scratch. This book is the result of that work.</p><h2>The Autobiography of Saint Therese of Lisieux</h2><p>Known as "The Little Flower of Jesus", Saint Therese of Lisieux spent nine years as a Carmelite religious. After serving in various offices, such as sacristan and novice mistress, she spent her final year-and-a-half in a night of faith and died of tuberculosis at the age of 24. The impact of her posthumous autobiography was great, and she became one of the most popular saints of the twentieth century. She was beatified in 1923, and canonized in 1925. Here is her heartwarming autobiography in a gift edition, presented simply&#x2014;free of the scholarly commentary, prefaces, footnotes, and supplements that have ballooned many current editions. Read this uplifting book from the Little Flower, and rediscover the meaning of charity, patience, selfless kindness, true penance and self-control.</p><p></p><h2>Church Is a Team Sport: A Championship Strategy for Doing Ministry Together</h2><p>Church Is a Team Sport shows proven ways to push believers, new and mature, toward growth as both Christians--and leaders. Through this powerful, thought-provoking volume, ministers both in the congregation and on staff will discover how to expand the church one soul at a time. Making disciples is the crux of the Church Is a Team Sport message. The plan works. Caring for people, following up on stray sheep, and teaching what it means to love God and obey him. That&#39;s how Church Is a Team Sport transforms Christians from Monday-morning quarterbacks into dynamic players.</p><p>A Championship Strategy for a Vibrant Church Church Is a Team Sport demonstrates proven coaching strategies to inspire believers to grow as a team of Christians and leaders.

I read it in one sitting and predict you will too. It&#39;s a championship strategy all the way.&#34;--Pat Williams, senior vice president, Orlando Magic; author, Read for Your LifeTo win the game, you need the whole team Pastor Jim Putman, a former wrestler and coach, helped his staff build Real Life Ministries into an army of thousands. But there was a problem. Early on too many sat on the sidelines. Not enough wanted a piece of the action. His voice was faltering from so many sermons and he teetered on the edge of burnout thanks to the mixed blessing of an enormous but needy flock. So he hit his knees. Hard. God&#39;s solution surprised him. Putman and his entire leadership team stood before the congregation and gave up. They were done carrying the whole load. There were too many spiritual babies and they needed mature believers to step up. They knew there must be some raw talent hidden in the pews. God led them to use a Bible-based strategy for ministry revitalization that can help bring your church to the next level. Whether you&#39;re a burned-out leader or someone ready to tackle an active role in your congregation, Church Is a Team Sport will lead you to both personal growth and renewed spiritual strength. If you&#39;re ready to get the whole team in the game, this is the playbook that will show you how to make it happen.</p><h2>The Reluctant Widow</h2><p>Elinor Rochdale is rather surprised that her new employer is quite rich, and more so at tile decayed grandeur of the house to which she is transported.

By midnight she is a bride, by dawn a widow...</p><p>Georgette Heyer is best known for her witty and charming Regency romances, but she is also responsible for a handful of mystery novels. On occasion, mystery would find its way into her romances, embroiling her well-born heroes and heroines in adventures that were alternately chilling and hilarious. In <i>The Reluctant Widow</i>, Eleanor Rochdale, a young woman of good birth but straitened circumstances, sets out to accept a position as a governess and ends up plunged into a tangle of foreign intrigue instead. <p> Eleanor's adventure begins when she inadvertently mistakes the carriage waiting at the coach stop for one sent by her prospective employer, Mrs. Macclesfield. She finds herself carried to the estate of one Ned Carlyon, whom Eleanor mistakes for Mr. Macclesfield. Carlyon, meanwhile, believes Eleanor to be the young woman he hired to marry his dying cousin, Eustace Cheviot, in order to avoid inheriting Cheviot's estate himself. Somehow, Eleanor is talked into marrying Eustace on his deathbed and thus becomes a wealthy widow almost as soon as the ring is on her finger. What starts out as a simple business arrangement soon becomes much more complicated as housebreakers, uninvited guests, a shocking murder, missing government papers, and a dog named Bouncer all contribute to this lively, frequently hilarious tale of mistaken identities, foreign espionage, and unexpected love set during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>By chance, Elinor Rochdale is swept up in a thrilling adventure. Overnight the would-be governess becomes mistress of a ruined estate and partner in a conspiracy to save a family&#39;s name. By midnight she is a bride, by dawn a widow.</p><h2>Rock Art of the Lower Pecos</h2><p>Four thousand years ago bands of hunter-gatherers lived in and traveled through the challenging terrain of what is now southwest Texas and northern Mexico. Today travelers to that land can view large art panels they left behind on the rock walls of Rattlesnake Canyon, White Shaman Cave, Panther Cave, Mystic Shelter, and Cedar Springs. Messages from a distant past, they are now interpreted for modern readers by artist-archaeologist Carolyn Boyd.<br><br>It has been thought that the meaning of this ancient art was lost with the artists who produced it. However, thanks to research breakthroughs, these elaborate rock paintings are again communicating a narrative that was inaccessible to humanity for millennia. In the gateway serpents, antlered shamans, and human-animal&#x2013;cross forms pictured in these ancient murals, Boyd sees a way that ancient hunter-gatherer artists could express their belief systems, provide a mechanism for social and environmental adaptation, and act as agents in the social, economic, and ideological affairs of the community. She offers detailed information gleaned from the art regarding the nature of the lower Pecos cosmos, ritual practices involving the use of sacramental and medicinal plants, and hunter-gatherer lifeways.<br><br>Now, combining the tools of the ethnologist with the aesthetic sensibilities of an artist, Boyd demonstrates that prehistoric art is not beyond explanation. Images from the past contain a vast corpus of data&#x2014;accessible through proven, scientific methods&#x2014;that can enrich our understanding of human life in prehistory and, at the same time, expand our appreciation for the work of art in the present and the future.</p><p>Carolyn E.

In the coming year, Shackleton would record the greatest achievements of his career and engage in his most daring adventures, returning home a hero. </p><p>Lacking funds and plagued by hunger, cruel weather, and unpredictable terrain, Shackleton and his party accomplished some of the most remarkable feats in the history of exploration. Not only were they the first to climb the active volcano of Mount Erebus, but they trudged hundreds of miles across uncharted wastelands to be the first ever to plant the Union Jack at the South Pole. </p><p>Shackleton's Forgotten Expedition is the definitive account of the British Antarctic Expedition. Using extensive research and firsthand accounts-some previously unpublished-Riffenburgh has written a vivid and gripping adventure while providing fascinating insight into the age of British exploration and empire.</p></p><p><p>Beau Riffenburgh is a historian specializing in exploration, particularly that of the Antarctic, the Arctic, and Africa, and the author of The Myth of the Explorer. A native of California, he earned his doctorate at the University of Cambridge and is currently on staff at the Scott Polar Research Institute, where he is the editor of the Encyclopaedia of the Antarctic and the journal Polar Record.</p>Ernest Shackleton's fame has been restored due to renewed interest in the heroic tale of the <i>Endurance</i> expedition, but his original celebrity status stemmed from an earlier voyage to the Antarctic from 1907 to 1909, during which he led a small group of men to within 97 miles of the South Pole. Riffenburgh (<i>The Myth of the Explorer</i>) recounts this journey in riveting detail, describing how Shackleton and his crew survived under harrowing conditions, sometimes brought on by their own tactical misjudgments, like the decision to rely heavily on ponies to carry supplies across the frozen landscape. The story also offers vital clues to Shackleton's personality, revealing how he first went to the Antarctic in order to impress his girlfriend and, more importantly, examining the competitive rivalry between Shackleton and fellow explorer Sir Robert Scott. Scott had sent Shackleton home from an earlier expedition for health reasons, and when Shackleton vowed to return to Antarctica in part to prove he was strong enough to make it, Scott viewed it as a threat to his own plans and unfairly extracted a promise from his former crewman not to use "his" base camps, adding further complications to the journey. For those who thrilled to the <i>Endurance </i>saga, Riffenburgh offers an equally gripping adventure, which laid the foundations of Shackleton's capacity for brilliant leadership under pressure. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From his spirited defense of "fish tales" to his exploration of dozens of moments in a "fly-fishing addict's" life, this collection of fifty essays is sure to delight his legions of fans. <p>Nick Lyons takes a hard and often whimsical look at how we all learn to fish, what we fish for, and where we cast our lines. Bluegills, bluefish, snook, chub, brown trout, bass, and salmon are all explored, along with the discretely different experiences of fishing in small ponds, major Western rivers, English chalk streams, and no-name brooks. Lyons can be hilarious when recording his misadventures as a fishing guide or inventor of new flies, contemplative when looking at the ethics or peculiarities of fishing, nostalgic and philosophical about a season past or an old fishing friend now dead. In the emotions it explores and records, Confessions of a Fly Fishing Addict is Lyons's broadest book. </p><p>"Bravo for the Confessions, from one addict to another!

Sosin </p><p>Nick Lyons was for twenty-six years an English professor at Hunter College and is now a book publisher. He has published more than four hundred articles and eighteen books, most of them on fishing. Mari Lyons's paintings and drawings have graced previous books by her husband. She shows regularly at the First Street Gallery in New York City.</p>These essays, reprinted from Fly Fisherman magazine, form a smooth and satisfying collection. A book publisher and essayist, Lyons ( Bright Rivers ) is adept at both writing and fly fishing--qualities in evidence despite his humility and self-deprecating humor, which prompt a friend to chide him: "You're downgrading yourself too much, Nick. You're not nearly so bad a fisherman as you make out." His language sparkles ("What a glorious pool it is. The water sweeps down from a four-hundred-yard-long riffle, hits the bend, and makes marvelously trouty music"), and sound advice is leavened with wit and charm. To make a dry fly appeal to a fish, he counsels, have it behave naturally. "If you saw a piece of steak moving unnaturally on your plate, would you eat it?" The various pieces range in style from touching simplicity to slapstick comedy. Fly fishing, Lyons contends, is a panacea, "a pleasant, restful time, with the kind of happy, leisurely rhythms that are addictive." So are his essays. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A PhD Is Not Enough: A Guide To Survival In Science</h2><p>Despite your graduate education, brainpower, and technical prowess, your career in scientific research is far from assured.

A little girl hides from a large hairy blue monster, and as the monster searches for her hiding place, children can lift the flap to find what's really there. Finally, the monster finds her behind a tree, and children turning the page will be taken aback by a two-page spread showing the huge monster bearing its teeth and shouting "Got you!" Then it is the monster's turn to hide. Illustrated in bright, bold felt-tip pens on white backgrounds, the book first leads readers to believe that a monster is chasing this child. The "Got you!" spread may scare some children to the point that they will be unable to finish the story and learn that the two are just playing a game. However, there are children who always want a scary book, and this might fit the bill if the fragile flaps, which will limit the circulation and life of this book, don't frighten you off. --Carol McMichael, Greenfield Public Library, Ind.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Girl Among the Anarchists</h2><p>Isabel Meredith is the narrator of <i>A Girl among the Anarchists</i> and the pseudonym of Helen and Olivia Rossetti, daughters of William Michael Rossetti and nieces of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Their fin-de-si�cle tenure as editors of the renowned British anarchist journal <i>The Torch</i> provided the experience that went into this entertaining and knowing novel. Young Isabel&#x2019;s description of her upbringing echoes the eccentricities of the Rosetti household. Isolated, restless, she feels a strong desire to "free" herself from "all the ideas, customs, and prejudices" of her class and to throw herself "into the life and work of the masses." She becomes immersed in a subversive community that was seldom seen by bourgeois women in late Victorian England. In picaresque fashion she recounts outlandish vignettes of the anarchist life-style. But in growing from a girl to a woman Isabel undergoes more than physical change.<p>Originally published in London in 1903, <i>A Girl Among the Anarchists</i> has long been hard to find.

It opens with the arrest of a bookstore owner for selling a copy of &#34;the most obscene piece of por�nography written since Gutenberg invented moveable type.&#34; This notorious, long-banned work which tells the thoughts inside a woman&#39;s head during the seven minutes she is engaged in sexual intercourse) is condemned under the Cal�ifornia Criminal Code for obscenity and is also charged with having driven a respectable college boy to commit a brutal rape and murder. Overnight, as the battle lines are drawn, the defenders of free speech rallying against the &#34;legions of censorship, the Los Angeles obscenity trial erupts into an international cause celebre. In the center of the storm is Michael Barrett, a young lawyer who unwillingly takes the case for the defense and pits himself against an honest but ambitious district attorney, who is backed by relentless and powerful political forces. Behind the scenes, at risk of his life, Bar�rett seeks the crucial truth about the mysterious and long dead expatriate author of the book on trial-a book that has become a rallying point in the fight for literary and sexual liberation as well as the symbol of Barrett&#39;s own maturity as a man. In his dangerous quest to save the book, the trial, his own future, Barrett crosses the paths of a galaxy of unforgettable characters-includ�ing the leering producer of filthy stag films, a sexually permissive society girl, a drunken Greenwich Village poet, the prelate representing the Vatican&#39;s Index of Prohibited Books.

They are often left with the same shape they struggled so hard to change. Lose Weight Here shows readers that "spot reduction" is possible and how they can lose weight quickly in all the right places.<br><br>Lose Weight Here rethinks traditional weight-management techniques by optimizing the two proven components for successful weight loss: low calories and hormone balance. By combining the hormonal science of fat burning with the revolutionary science of spot training, Lose Weight Here shows readers how to reverse metabolic damage so they can get the bodies of their dreams.<br><br>Lose Weight Here is based on hard science, sound nutritional and psychological data, and remarkable testimonials, which include before-and-after photos from some of the 100,000 people Jade and Keoni Teta have helped in their gym and online. Unlike traditional diets, Lose Weight Here instructs readers on how to successfully alternate between periods when you eat more and exercise more, and periods when you eat less and exercise less. This method deactivates fat storing receptors and targets the belly, butt, hips, and thighs. At last, dieters can lose fat in targeted areas and maintain their results.</p><p>Jade and Keoni Teta have 20 years of experience as trainers and have practiced integrative and complementary medicine for 10 years.

You pulled as hard as you could and the other side pulled back just as hard. You dug your heels in deeper, and they responded in kind. The battle continued until both sides became so tired they fell to the ground exhausted, with no clear winner. This is the game your metabolism is playing with you when you decide to diet using the traditional, status quo method: Eating Less, Exercising More.<br><br>We call it the Law of Metabolic Compensation, and it is the single most important element to understand about your metabolism. As you diet using the flawed Eat Less, Exercise More model, you set in motion a host of metabolic adjustments that lead to greater hunger, lower energy, increased cravings, and decreased metabolic rate. All of these changes are the way your metabolic thermostat tries to protect you from the stress of dieting.<br><br>Your body does this as a defense against what it perceives as starvation. Eat less, and you will have hormonal and brain chemistry changes that increase hunger and cravings. The body is intelligent, and its primary concern is defending its fat stores because it knows that once your body fat is gone, it can't survive. So it first increases hunger and cravings so you will eat more, then slows the metabolic rate so you will burn less. But remember the tug-of-war battle? Your metabolism is just as strong, if not stronger, than your willpower, and it becomes even more resistant the harder you work--to the point where it can halt or even reverse your dieting efforts.<br><br>You can certainly continue this tug-of-war game, but you likely won't win. Eventually, you will end up on the gym floor, a heap of exhausted rubble with a host of metabolic issues. This is metabolic damage, a state in which your metabolism inhibits weight loss and you also experience chronic fatigue, lack of motivation, mood changes, and digestive distress.<br><br>What happens when you let go of the rope in a tug-of-war battle? The other team goes tumbling helplessly to the ground. Letting go of the Eat Less, Exercise More dieting model is the first and most critical step in getting your metabolism back on track so you can attack stubborn body fat and trim down your shape. By working with the Law of Metabolic Compensation, you win the game of tug-of-war with your diet every time.<br><br>Letting go of the Eat Less, Exercise More dieting model is the first and most critical step in getting your metabolism back on track so you can attack stubborn body fat and trim your shape.<br><br>Once you let go of traditional dieting, what do you do? There are two ways to create a calorie deficit and balance hormones for sustained fat loss. You can either Eat Less, Exercise Less (ELEL) or you can Eat More, Exercise More (EMEM). On this plan you'll do both, but at strategic and proven- effective intervals.<br><br>First, though, we're going to ask you to forget everything you know about weight loss and diets and start over. Let go of the rope. We want to reprogram your thinking. The way you've been addressing it so far, overall, is wrong. Reprogram your thinking and approach, and you will reprogram your lifestyle and see astonishing results. You won't gain back the weight you lose, and you'll be able to take off the really stubborn weight you've struggled with. You will reshape your body.<br><br>We're going to say it over and over: This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. The science applies to everybody, sure, but the exact formula you'll use to lose is very individual. Our science and plans will allow you to be a diet detective and tweak what we're offering you for optimum results. We are aware that this can be challenging because we all like black-and-white rules and certainty, but understanding that gray is everywhere will make you excel at doing the detective work. We call it structured flexibility. We'll provide the structure, you be flexible as you find the correct approach. We're not urging you to think like a "dieter"-- we want you to think like a detective, sleuthing to create a path to the happiest, healthiest you. Before you lose any weight, you have to learn how to balance your metabolism. That's what we'll do first in this book.<br><br>Can You Burn and Build at the Same Time?<br><br>The Myth of Metabolic Multitasking<br><br>To reshape your body, you have to both burn fat and develop muscle. The problem? Your metabolism isn't good at burning fat and building muscle at the same time. These two processes require completely different metabolic actions. They also require different hormonal signals. Building muscle requires insulin, while releasing fat for burning requires lower insulin. Burning fat and building muscle at the same time is the metabolic equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time-- it's not an easy task.<br><br>We call this the myth of metabolic multi tasking. In reality, the body divvies up resources between burning fat (catabolism) and building muscle (anabolism). Your body wants to burn or build, but not both at the same time.<br><br>Understanding this aspect of metabolism allows you to fully harness its power. It's like trying to talk on the phone, cook dinner, and keep your kids from fighting with each other at the same time. You won't accomplish any of them well. Your phone conversation will be constantly interrupted. You'll burn dinner--or yourself. Your kids may take it into the other room, but they'll continue fighting. To succeed, you have to give each task your full attention.<br><br>When you buy in to the myth of metabolic multitasking, you think that as you burn fat, you can simultaneously build muscle, but in reality, you'll be burning muscle too, and can wind up "skinny fat"--smaller than you were, but still flabby because you lost so much muscle. Likewise, if you try to build muscle in order to lose fat, you will add fat along with muscle and just look bulky. To burn fat and build muscle, the Lose Weight Here plan harnesses your metabolism's strengths at key times, so you'll alternate periods of burning fat and reducing your body mass with periods of muscle building and contouring.<br><br>Once you understand that metabolic multitasking is a myth and you begin to honor the Law of Metabolic Compensation, you'll start to burn fat from all over your body. The stubborn fat in troublesome areas will be burned off more quickly, too. Then, you can speed up the process even more by using the specific diet, exercise, and lifestyle techniques we'll be teaching you.<br><br>Balancing your metabolism will:<br><br>Curb hunger so you can naturally cut calories<br><br>Bolster energy<br><br>Control cravings for unhealthy foods<br><br>The end result: You'll finally achieve sustainable weight loss. We're busting the dieting myth here, and the proof will be the reshaping of your body.<br><br>CHECKING IN<br><br>Throughout this book, we're going to remind you to check in with yourself in a couple of ways.<br><br>Take AIM<br><br>You may feel like checking out when we talk about hormones, but understanding this information is vital to your success. To help you keep track of your hormones and their effects on your body, we break it down into the AIM process. Using it, you will Assess, Investigate, and Modify what you're doing until you find the key to losing weight. We'll arm you in the coming pages with the know-how to do just that, but you, as our partner in this, have to do the detective work.<br><br>Get Your HEC in Check<br><br>If your HEC--your hunger, energy, and cravings--is in check and balanced, you know your hormones and your metabolism are balanced, too--and no calorie counting is required. Hormones like insulin, cortisol, leptin, thyroid, and others have direct and indirect influence on your levels of hunger, energy, and cravings. When you are optimally producing and reacting to these hormones, HEC stays in check. If you do not produce the right amounts of hormones or lose the ability to respond to them (a condition called hormone resistance), HEC goes out of check.<br><br>MAJOR EFFECTS OF METABOLIC SLOWDOWN<br><br>Scientists have a pretty good handle on what might be happening when your metabolism slows down. There are many potential issues here, but we are going to cover what appear to be the three major effects that lead to this issue of weight-loss resistance and weight gain. One of them is probably going to surprise you.<br><br>Loss of Muscle Mass<br><br>Research shows that the basal metabolic rate (BMR)--the amount of energy you would burn in a day if you just sat around and did nothing--accounts for more than two-thirds of the calories burned in a day. Muscle tissues use more than half of the energy we burn at rest, so one of the best ways to offset the Law of Metabolic Compensation is to do everything in your power to gain or at least maintain muscle. To do that, protein and weight training are your best tools.<br><br>A study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition in April 1999 showed this effect. This study looked at a group of obese individuals who were put on a very-low-calorie diet and assigned to one of two exercise regimens. One group did aerobic exercise (walking, biking, or jogging four times per week), while the second group did resistance training three times per week and no aerobic exercise.<br><br>At the end of the 12-week study, both groups had lost weight, but the difference in the amount of muscle loss versus fat loss was telling. The aerobic group lost 37 �ds over the course of the study. Ten of those �ds came from muscle. In contrast, the resistance-training group lost 32 �ds. None of the weight they lost came from muscle. When the average BMR for each group was calculated, the aerobic group was shown to be burning 210 fewer calories per day. The resistance-training group was instead burning 63 more calories per day.<br><br>Hormonal Changes: Leptin and Thyroid<br><br>Whether you reduce calories or lower carbs, one of the first things that occurs in dieters is a beneficial change in the amount and/or sensitivity of the hormone insulin. Insulin also acts as a hunger hormone, so this change, while beneficial in the short run, is one of the first and earliest changes resulting in metabolic compensation. This causes increased hunger. Other hormones are also impacted. Cortisol, which is released when you're under stress, and ghrelin, which controls your appetite, are both elevated in spurts. This too causes increased hunger and cravings.<br><br>Along with the increased hunger and cravings comes the metabolic slowdown. This is most impacted by the metabolic hormone leptin. When a fat cell is shrinking and exposed to less insulin, leptin is also reduced. Low leptin excretion means increased hunger. Low leptin also means decreased activity of the body's two major metabolic engines, the thyroid and the adrenal glands. So as leptin decreases, your metabolism gets the signal to stop burning energy and instead start storing it.<br><br>Signs You Might Have Metabolic Damage<br><br>Waist measurement of more than 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men<br><br>An inability to control hunger and cravings<br><br>High blood pressure (above 140/90 without medication)<br><br>High-normal fasting blood sugar (higher than 95 to 100)<br><br>Lipid abnormalities (high triglycerides and LDL cholesterol and low HDL)<br><br>If you do indeed have metabolic damage, the first step is to avoid the Eat Less, Exercise More approach. First you need to "fix the glitch" by avoiding the dieting mentality. Next you need to cycle the diet in a way that makes your metabolism more flexible and balanced and attacks stubborn fat, especially around the belly. Finally, you may require special supplements that aid insulin signaling and manage some of the symptoms. These might include alpha-lipoic acid, magnesium, B vitamins, berberine, and green tea extract. Talk with your doctor about the best approach to reversing your damage.<br><br>Leptin is considered by many to be the most important metabolic hormone in terms of setting metabolic output and weight regain. If you want to keep your metabolic rate up, you have to make sure your leptin level doesn't fall too fast, which we'll address later. The Lose Weight Here plan balances your leptin level and increases your metabolic rate. This effect varies substantially from person to person, with some people showing no effect from the brief period of overfeeding and others seeing a jump in resting calorie burn of several hundred calories per day.<br><br>Persistent Organic Pollutants<br><br>Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of hormone-disrupting chemicals that have a huge impact on metabolic compensation during dieting. These com�ds have accumulated in your fat cells, and when fat is burned, they are released into your bloodstream in significant concentrations. The shocking thing about these com�ds is that they do not come from your body. They are man-made chemicals that you eat, put on your skin, drink in your water, and inhale in the air; some examples are pesticides like DDT; com�ds leached from plastics, such as bisphenol A, or BPA; and other industrial chemicals, like phthalates, and by-products of their breakdown, such as dioxins. Until very recently, no one understood how these com�ds were involved in weight-loss resistance.<br><br>POPs are fat soluble, and thus become concentrated in fat. This means they're stored in the fat of animals that you eat, and also in your fat after you consume that animal fat. You can almost see this as a protective mechanism: If the POPs are in your fat cells, they can't do as much damage as when they're in your blood. So when they get in your body, you store them away in fat, where they biodegrade only very slowly. When you lose fat, however, they are released in significant amounts that can do more damage and slow the metabolism.<br><br>The bottom line is that when you lose fat, you will release more POPs-- there is no way of getting around that, even though losing fat is a primary goal on the Lose Weight Here plan. But because this plan is very high in fiber (which binds to and helps remove toxins) and protein (which is required to make detoxifying enzymes) and is lower in fat (which means less POPs are coming in), it is the best tool we have to deal with this. We also try to do things in a way that mitigates the other two major causes of metabolic compensation: loss of muscle and hormonal changes.<br><br>POPs primarily impact the thyroid gland by decreasing its ability to make thyroid hormone, disrupting thyroid hormones once they are made, and speeding up the excretion of thyroid hormones. In other words, POPs damage thyroid function and drastically suppress metabolic function.<br><br>ACTIONS TO TAKE<br><br>We realize that this new information about metabolic compensation can be both exciting and confusing. Exciting because you finally have answers for why you regained all the weight and more from your last diet and why weight loss has been so difficult since then. Confusing, because what the hell do you do about it now?</p><h2>Marion Zimmer Bradley&#39;s Ravens of Avalon</h2><p>Epic in its sweep and peopled by the remarkable women who have always inhabited Avalon, <i>Marion Zimmer Bradley?s Ravens of Avalon</i> expands the legendary saga that has enchanted millions of readers over the years and is sure to please Bradley?s loyal readership and anyone who loves wonderfully told stories of history, myth, and fantasy.</p><p>Diana L.

A truly gifted painter, best known for her loving, detailed illustrations of cats.K-Gr 3-Katje has an easy life. She keeps Nico's mill free of mice during the week, chases seagulls on Sundays, and sleeps on her owner's pillow at night. All that changes when he brings home a wife, who scolds the cat for her dusty paws and banishes her from the bedroom. When their baby arrives, the feline loves playing with her and gently rocking her cradle. Lena scolds again, saying that the cat will make the baby sneeze or tip the cradle, and a forlorn Katje takes up residence in the mill instead of the house. However, when a violent storm breaks through the dike and floodwaters wash the cradle out of the house, it is Katje who rescues Anneke by leaping from side to side to keep the cradle upright. Her place of honor in the family secure, she returns to the house, although she now remembers to lick her paws before entering.

Discovered in a wall of the Dickinson family house during renovations in 1915, the diary at last has fallen into the hands of its present editor, who presents it here for the light it casts on the private life of the great and enigmatic poet. And what light is that? Well, not really very much, it seems, other than that Emily Dickinson lived quietly with her family in Amherst, wrote her poetry unobtrusively, died unmarried, and became hugely famous only later. Fuller takes no liberties here of the adventuring or gothic sort, conjuring up no ghost, perversion, trauma, or previously unknown disaster to explain her subject's perplexing reclusiveness and preternatural modesty. Instead, this Emily Dickinson is skeptical and intelligent, obedient but observant as a daughter, intensely dedicated to the cultivation of her poetic gift--and not so much repressed as simply unlucky in the department of passion, her love for the somewhat older Judge Otis Phillips Lord, for example, being unfulfilled thanks to time's cruel snatching away of opportunity less than (although room for interpretation is allowed) to the repression of desire. A real-life and common-sense Emily Dickinson emerges, then, captivating not for the operatic whisperings of dark secrets, but for the quiet authenticity of voice, place, and time that Fuller deftly conjures up. Her own hand at Dickinsonian verse is considerable (25 ``new'' poems are included), and, except for occasional stumblings in diary entries too expository to be realistic (``It was in summer at our Commencement tea that I let my heart deceive me''), so is her gift for the finer sounds of prose (``When the Bible proclaims eternal life, I hear only the silent drop of Death''). Lovely in conception, words, character, detail--but extraordinarily motionless and still. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The most glaring difference between the work of Emily Dickinson and this novel "in the style of" the belle of Amherst can be simply put: offered the real McCoy, the reader never wonders if his time is being wasted. Fuller brings an unmistakable talent for research and an ear for language to her first book, but she doesn't demonstrate much purpose. Here, she simulates entries and poems in a diary "kept" by Dickinson from 1867 to 1868, then "annotates" these with factual material and published verse. While her use of language is reasonably convincing, she doesn't interpret Dickinson's life with much imagination. Essentially, she unravels Dickinson's correspondences and Dickinson research, then threads her findings into diary entries. For example, Emily reports returning a copy of Nicholas Nickleby to her sister-in-law, although she does not comment upon it; the appended note reveals that the book is part of the Dickinson family library now at Harvard. Elsewhere, this Emily schoolgirlishly appraises Aurora Leigh ; comments on newspaper items; and, unavoidably, issues passionate declarations about poetry and cryptic statements about those she loves. If anything, Fuller has made an already circumscribed life seem even narrower.

In the impoverished rural community in which he works, John Sassall tend the maimed, the dying, and the lonely. He is not only the dispenser of cures but the repository of memories. And as Berger and Mohr follow Sassall about his rounds, they produce a book whose careful detail broadens into a meditation on the value we assign a human life. First published thirty years ago, <b>A Fortunate Man</b> remains moving and deeply relevant--no other book has offered such a close and passionate investigation of the roles doctors play in their society.<br>"In contemporary letters John Berger seems to me peerless; not since Lawrence has there been a writer who offers such attentiveness to the sensual world with responsiveness to the imperatives of conscience."--Susan Sontag</p><p><b>Berger's exploration of what it means to heal, now inducted into the Canons series nearly fifty years after its first publication</b>John Berger is an English art critic, novelist, painter and poet.

It includes a diverse range of objects and documents that span five centuries of African-American life, from trade cards to kitchen novelties; dolls and toys to sports and civil-rights mementos; cereal boxes and product labels to books and sheet music; and even the shackles, classified ads, and bills of sale that document the long years of black slavery. <br><br>Often harsh and painful to examine, these artifacts nonetheless offer an important window into American history. They have become highly valued collectibles, and especially so among African Americans. <br><br><i>The Art and History of Black Memorabilia</i>, by Larry Vincent Buster, is the first fully illustrated overview of this remarkable area of Americana. With more than two hundred color photographs, this volume examines the most desirable black collectibles and places them within their historical and social contexts. The author, himself a noted collector, includes information on how to buy, display, and preserve black memorabilia and explains how to spot fakes and reproductions. Also included are explorations of some of the most well-known and influential African-American figures in popular culture. <br><br>At times horrifying yet sublime, insulting yet intriguing, humorous, heartbreaking, and inspiring, <i>The Art and History of Black Memorabilia</i> is a landmark chronicle of the black experience in America.</p><p>The first definitive text on the subject, <i>The Art and History of Black Memorabilia</i> provides a sensitive rendering of a difficult topic and intelligently discusses a variety of interpretations for a large range of products and advertisements that relate to the experience of African Americans. Beginning with a brief timeline of specific events in African American history, author Larry Vincent Buster balances discussions of modern pop culture, politics, and the international slave trade from 1324 to 1995. Buster's preface makes it clear that his writing is both a labor of love and a scholarly document--he was willed a large collection of memorabilia from a friend, and his examination of this collection led him to write this book.<p> Each chapter details a particular type of relic, including accessories to the slave trade, printed entertainment posters and advertisements, dolls, bric-a-brac, and magazines, photos, and books related to more recent heroes like Martin Luther King Jr., Joe Louis, Malcolm X, and Madam C.J. Walker. Throughout the book, special sections are devoted to characters of particular importance, ranging from Little Black Sambo to Josephine Baker. In all cases, the text addresses the variety of emotions these collections inspire, as well as the practical details related to collecting: pricing, rarity, popularity, and specifics on how to spot fakes. Buster's words on Aunt Jemima express the multiple meanings behind the memorabilia as a whole: "Aunt Jemima and her clones have come out of the closet as collectibles, coveted by connoisseurs.... Others are mystified by her power to degrade, anger and offend." Certainly, collectors and historians alike have much to learn from Buster's work, and <i>The Art and History of Black Memorabilia</i> is sure to serve as both a conversation starter and reference guide for years to come. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>"For those who like to remember, and to have at hand some splendid mementos of what the past was like to African Americans, this is a treasure chest." <br>-- Ossie Davis, actor/civil rights activist<br><br>"This book is great, everything you ever wanted to know about black memorabilia but were too politically correct to ask." <br>-- Whoopi Goldberg, actor/collector<br>"I hope that the reader will take away from these pages a feel for the urgency and necessity of collecting black history. I hope that we all will seek to recover who we are and to use that restored memory to achieve even greater levels of success in the future." <br>-- Charles L. Blockson, curator, Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection, Temple University<br><br>"Larry Vincent Buster's The Art and History of Black Memorabilia is a very necessary documentation of the history of the black experience in American history.

The title introduces a metaphor surrounding the proverbial conference room table. It suggests that as wealth increases in our society, wealth holders are demanding a different model for assembling their team of professional advisers. Team members will take specific seats at the table, next to or across from the wealth holder, based on the role they are best suited to play. As more and more advisers adopt authenticity in their selection, wealth holders will become savvier to those trying to disguise their underlying relationship goals. Advisers must be clear about where they're meant to sit and why. <p>It's also about helping our clients get to the root of their intent. So much of financial services is focused on tax savings and tax elimination. Yet for people who have financial independence, that can't possibly be their ultimate goal for their wealth. How could it? Life has so much more to offer.</p><p>To help wealth holders find the true intent for their wealth requires deep discovery, skillful discovery. It requires conversations in which there isn't a single product idea, service mix, or technical strategy dangling in the back of the adviser's mind. The quality of the wealth holder's choices increases in direct proportion to the quality of discovery used to facilitate them. This is a discernment-based style of communication, which is the foundation of our teachings and of this book. We believe that soon there will be a discernment-based adviser at every planning table. In the <i>Right Side of the Table</i> model, successful advisers will embrace an abundance mentality, inviting additional advisers to the table to fill roles the core team isn't suited to play.</p><p>The opportunities for professional advisers are tremendous. The time has come to make an intentional and wise choice. Which is the right side of the table for you?</p></p><p>Scott Fithian was widely recognized as a pioneer in the financial services industry. He spent his career developing tools, systems, and strategies designed to put the clients' mission and values at the center of the planning process. His work made him a sought after author, public speaker, and trainer in the profession. His brilliant career was cut short in September 2006 after an 18-month battle with cancer, but his legacy lives on.<p> Todd Fithian is cofounder and CEO of the Legacy Companies, and a frequent speaker on the subjects of client discovery and sustainability. He has consulted with business owners, corporations and families in the U.S., Canada, and Australia.</p>Scott Fithian laid the groundwork for a new wave in the financial planning industry that will change the way that people will look at their life and their money. Through this book and through his brother Todd, the work will continue. --Jim Stovall, author, <i>The Ultimate Gift</i><br><br>The title of this book, therefore, perfectly sums up Scott s approach, looking at things entirely through the clientele's eyes. Being on the 'right side' of the table, for Scott, meant forgetting about what you wanted to sell. The question was what did the client want to achieve? Scott's approach looked at clients as whole human beings who had concerns and aspirations that spanned their own lifetimes and beyond. --From the foreword by Dan Sullivan, Founder of the Strategic Coach<br><br>I've had the honor of working with Scott and Todd Fithian on a couple of projects, including the movie "The Ultimate Gift," and I got to know them and their organization pretty well. Scott was the most visionary person I have ever met in the financial services industry. Todd is a dedicated professional who knows how to execute a plan, especially the one his brother has left behind. <i>The Right Side of the Table: Where Do You Sit in the Minds of the Affluent</i> is a great guide to how to work with affluent clients in today's environment. It is written from the perspective of putting your clients first and creating a team environment where you can become the trusted adviser to the growing affluent marketplace. --Jim Barnash, Former President of FPA</p><h2>When Brooklyn Was Queer: A History</h2><p><p><b>The never-before-told story of Brooklyn&#x2019;s vibrant and forgotten queer history, from the mid-1850s up to the present day.</b><br><b></b><br><b>***NAMED ONE OF THE BEST LGBTQ BOOKS OF 2019 by Harper's Bazaar***</b> </p><p>"A romantic, exquisite history of gay culture." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred</p><p>&#x201c;[A] boisterous, motley new history...entertaining and insightful.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>Hugh Ryan&#x2019;s <i>When Brooklyn Was Queer </i>is a groundbreaking exploration of the LGBT history of Brooklyn, from the early days of Walt Whitman in the 1850s up through the queer women who worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during World War II, and beyond.

In this cauldron Arawn has created his terrible army of deathless warriors from the stolen bodies of the slain. For each of those chosen to journey to Arawn&#39;s domain, the quest has a special meaning, and to Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper, the adventure becomes a glorious opportunity to wear his first sword and prove himself a man among men.Peace reigns in Caer Dallben, where Taran works as Assistant Pig-Keeper, but evil threatens the rest of Prydain. The diabolical Arawn&#39;s army grows every day, and his terrible warriors never die. They are born in the Black Cauldron from the stolen bodies of slain soldiers. If evil is to be defeated, the cauldron must be destroyed. Taran volunteers to travel to Arawn&#39;s stronghold and assist in the destruction of the dreaded cauldron. With his faithful friends reassembled, Taran marches off to face great danger with a courageous heart.</p><h2>Dezert Isle</h2><p>Jules is a Zert. He lives on DeZert Isle with his best friend Ned the Nail, and he's in love with a brick.<br><br>Jules's life is happy and busy; he has plenty of friends, lots of games to play, and sausages to tempt the brick of his dreams. But there are certain things he detests: being hammered by SledgeHead, being swallowed by BigMouths, and being captured by SmotherHen (why does she keep trying to hatch him?)<br><br>DeZert Isle offers a guided tour of Jules's marvelous world, an up-close and personal visit to the high life and occasional low points of a sun-drenched place where new friends are just around the corner and gifts are offered with an open heart and where there's always enough hippopotamelon juice to go around.<br><br>Claude Ponti writes and illustrates children's books with an imagination, style, and wit we find especially captivating.

His lively drawings invite us into a technicolour landscape full of excitement, and wonder. Each story, rich with puns and jokes, inhabits a delicious world of imaginary creatures, where toys spring to life and the sun just may bump into the moon. Like the best books for youngsters, DeZert Isle sees the world from a child&#39;s perspective; the improbable becomes the possible, and all things, even the most bizarre, have perfectly reasonable explanations - even being in love with a brick.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;DeZert Isle is the land of the Zerts, personified blocks come to life in a place made fabulous by Ponti's weird imagination. Life for them is never dull. Their days are spent outwitting and avoiding their enemies&#x2013;the BigMouths, who lie down in front of them and become yawning holes to fall into; SledgeHead, who hammers anything he meets; and SmotherHen, who is given to forcible Zert adoption. The book is organized into chapters in a modified comic-book format and follows the course of Jules's passionate attachment to an insensate, inanimate brick that remains impervious to his attempts to woo her with flowers, sausages, and hippopotamelon juice. Eventually a gardener breaks the news to Jules that the brick will never respond, and after a slight head injury leaving him all "wibbly wobbly," the young protagonist falls in love with a female Zert instead. The landscape and inhabitants of DeZert Isle have a look of wooden toys. The sun and the moon have faces, as do mushrooms; fish have propellers and birds have wheels. Strangely, the rest of the DeZert Isle population consists of nails. The illustrations are bright and funny, rich with details and visual tricks. This story is sure to be a hit with the younger crowd and is a good choice for slightly older reluctant readers.&#x2013;<i>Jane Barrer, Washington Square Village Creative Steps, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Welcome to the insane and rarified world of Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld of the Institute of Romance Philology. Von Igelfeld is engaged in a never-ending quest to win the respect he feels certain he is due-a quest which has the tendency to go hilariously astray. In The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs, Professor Dr. Von Igelfeld is mistaken for a veterinarian and not wanting to call attention to the faux pas, begins practicing veterinary medicine without a license. He ends up operating on a friend&#39;s dachshund to dramatic and unfortunate effect. He also transports relics for a schismatically challenged Coptic prelate, and is pursued by marriage-minded widows on board a Mediterranean cruise ship.</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is a Professor of Medical Law as well as the author of over 50 books from FORENSIC ASPECTS OF SLEEP to THE CRIMINAL LAW OF BOTSWANA, THE PERFECT HAMBURGER (for children) to PORTUGUESE IRREGULAR VERBS (short stories).eins <br>THE FINER POINTS OF SAUSAGE DOGS <br><br>PROFESSOR DR MORITZ-MARIA VON IGELFELD, author of that great triumph of Germanic scholarship, <i>Portuguese Irregular Verbs</i>, had never set foot on American shores. It is true that he had corresponded from time to time with a number of noted American philologists--Professor Giles Reid of Cornell, for example, and Professor Paul Lafouche III of Tulane--and it is also true that they had often pressed him to attend the annual meeting of the American Modern Languages Association, but he had never been in a position to accept. Or so von Igelfeld said; the reality was he had never wanted to go and had invariably come up with some excuse to turn down the invitations. <br><br>'I have absolutely no interest in the New World,' von Igelfeld said dismissively to Professor Dr Florianus Prinzel. 'Is there anything there that we can't find in Germany? Anything at all? Can you name one thing?' <br><br>Prinzel thought for a moment. Cowboys? He was a secret admirer of cowboy films but he could never mention this to von Igelfeld, who, as far as he knew, had never watched a film in his life, let alone one featuring cowboys. Prinzel rather liked the idea of America, and would have been delighted to be invited there, preferably to somewhere in the West. <br><br>Then, one morning, Prinzel's invitation arrived--and from no less an institution than the ideally situated University of San Antonio. This was a city redolent of cowboys and the Mexican border, and Prinzel immediately telephoned von Igelfeld to tell him the good news. <br><br>Von Igelfeld congratulated him warmly, but when he replaced the receiver his expression had hardened. It was quite unacceptable that Prinzel should go to America before he did. After all, the Americans might think that Prinzel, rather than he, von Igelfeld, represented German philology, and this, frankly, would never do. Quite apart from that, if Prinzel went first, they would never hear the end of it. <br><br>'I have no alternative but to go there,' he said to himself. 'And I shall have to make sure that I go before Prinzel. It's simply a matter of duty.'<br>Von Igelfeld found himself in a difficult position. He could hardly approach any of his American friends and solicit an invitation, particularly after he had so consistently turned them down in the past. And yet the chance that an invitation would arrive of its own accord was extremely slender. <br><br>Over coffee at the Institute the next day, he directed a casual question at Professor Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer. <br><br>'Tell me, Herr Unterholzer,' he said. 'If you were to want to go to America to give a lecture, how would you . . . well, how would you get yourself invited, so to speak?' Quickly adding: 'Not that I would ever be in such a position myself, but you yourself could be, could you not?' <br><br>Unterholzer had an immediate answer. <br><br>'I should contact the <i>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</i>,' he said. 'I should tell them who I was and I should ask them to arrange a lecture somewhere in America. That is what they are paid to do.' <br><br>'I see,' said von Igelfeld. 'That would no doubt save embarrassment.' <br><br>'Of course,' said Unterholzer. 'They are experts in finding places for German academics to go and lecture to other people, whether or not they want to hear them. They are very persuasive people. That is how I went to Buenos Aires and gave my lecture there. It really works.' <br><br>And indeed it did. The local director of the <i>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</i> was delighted to hear from von Igelfeld the following day and assured him that a scholar of his eminence would be snapped up should he deign to leave Germany. It was only a question of finding the right institution and making the detailed arrangements. <br><br>'Rest assured that you will be invited within days,' von Igelfeld was promised. 'Just leave it all in our capable hands.'<br>Thus von Igelfeld found himself arriving in Fayetteville, Arkansas, a charming college town nestling in the Ozark Mountains, seat of the University of Arkansas, or at least of that part not located in the minor campus at Little Rock. When the whole idea was conceived, he had not envisaged going to Arkansas. He had imagined that his destination might be California, or New York, perhaps, but one American state was very much the same as another--at least in von Igelfeld's view, and it really made no difference. The important thing was that he was going to America, and a good two weeks ahead of Prinzel. <br><br>Von Igelfeld's hosts greeted him warmly. They had insisted that he stay with them, rather than in a hotel, and so von Igelfeld found himself installed in the sleeping porch of a traditional Ozark farmhouse on the edge of the town, the home of Professor R. B. Leflar. After he had unpacked, he and von Igelfeld sat down on the swing-seat on the front verandah and discussed his programme. There would be visits to the surrounding area the next day, promised Professor Leflar, and the day after that a set-piece lecture had been planned before an open audience. <br><br>That night, after dinner, von Igelfeld retired to his bed and looked out through the gauze-covered porch windows. The house was surrounded by mixed forest, oak trees and sycamores, and their shapes, dark silhouettes, swayed in the breeze. And there, he thought, there's the moon, rising slowly over the trees like a giant lantern. What were they planning for him tomorrow? Would they show him their libraries? Were there manuscripts? What about Leflar's maternal grandfather, the adventurer, Charles Finger? He had been in South America and may have come across some Portuguese manuscripts of note, which could well be in the attic above his very head. Arkansas, it seemed, was rich in possibilities for the philologist. <br><br>The next morning he ate a hearty breakfast with Professor and Mrs Leflar before they set off. <br><br>'We're heading north,' said his host. 'We'll show you a typical hog operation.' <br><br>'Most intriguing,' said von Igelfeld. 'I am always interested in . . .' He paused. What was he interested in? Philology? Portuguese verbs? 'I am always interested in everything.' <br><br>They drove out of town, following a road that wound up into the hills. It was a gentle landscape--limestone hills which had been softened by the action of the rain; meandering valleys dotted with farmhouses under shady oak trees. Von Igelfeld had not thought of America as being at all like this; there were no dry plains, no glittering Dallas in the distance, no leafy suburbia with neat white houses. This could have been Bavaria, or even Austria. <br><br>Suddenly Leflar turned off the road and followed a dusty track leading towards a large, unpainted barn. <br><br>'Here we are,' he said. 'They're expecting us.' <br><br>The farmer came out and shook von Igelfeld's hand. Von Igelfeld sniffed the air; it was distinctly malodorous. <br><br>'This way,' said the farmer. 'The hogs are in here.' <br><br>The farmer opened a door in the side of the barn and ushered von Igelfeld inside. For the next half hour, they wandered between rows of spacious sties, each surmounted by a large sun lamp and each filled with a squealing mass of pigs. The farmer demonstrated the automatic feeding system and showed von Igelfeld the blood-sampling equipment. <br><br>'We're mighty careful about viruses here,' he said. 'You'd know all about that.' <br><br>Von Igelfeld looked at the farmer. Did pigs get colds, he wondered? <br><br>'You have to be careful about viruses,' he agreed. 'I myself always use vitamin C during the winter . . .' <br><br>He did not finish. 'You're right,' said the farmer. 'Each pig gets sixty IU vitamin C every morning with its food. And then we give them a shot of B group when they're seven weeks old. Some people are trying a short course of potassium a week before market. What do you think?' <br><br>Von Igelfeld shook his head. 'You have to be careful,' he said. 'I would never use potassium myself.' <br><br>The farmer listened intently. 'You hear that, Professor Leflar? No potassium. I'm inclined to agree with our visitor. You tell those folks down in Little Rock, no potassium--the Germans recommend against it.' <br><br>Leflar nodded. 'Could be,' he said. <br><br>An hour later they set off again. After a brief lunch, they made their way to a chicken farm, where von Igelfeld was shown the latest methods of production by a farmer who spoke in such a way that he could understand not one word. Then there was a call at some sort of animal laboratory, which interested von Igelfeld very little. Then home to dinner. <br><br>That night, in the silence of his sleeping porch, von Igelfeld reflected on his day. It had been interesting, in its way, but he wondered why they had chosen to show him all those farms and animals. Animals were all very well; indeed he had once written a small paper on the nature of collective nouns used for groups of animals, but that was about as far as his interest went. Still, this was America, and he assumed that this was what they laid on for all their visitors.<br>The lecture was to be at six thirty, following a short reception. When von Igelfeld arrived with Leflar the audience was largely assembled, milling about the ante-room of the lecture theatre. Glasses of wine had been provided, and plates of snacks were being circulated by waitresses dressed in black and white. <br><br>Everybody seemed keen to talk to von Igelfeld. <br><br>'We've all heard about your work,' said one man in a lightweight blue suit. 'In fact, I've got an off-print here which I thought you might care to sign.' <br><br>'I'd be happy to do so,' said von Igelfeld. And what about <i>Portuguese Irregular Verbs</i>? he reflected. Were there copies even here in Fayetteville, amongst these charming hills? <br><br>The man in the blue suit produced a pamphlet from his pocket. <br><br>'I was sent this by a colleague in Germany,' he said. 'He thought that I might find it useful. And I sure did.' <br><br>Von Igelfeld took the pamphlet. The cover was unfamiliar; all his off-prints from the <i>Zeitschrift</i> were bound in a plain white cover. This one was blue. <br><br>He adjusted his reading glasses and looked at the title page. <br><br><i>Further Studies of Canine Pulmonary Efficiency</i>, he read. And then: <i>by Professor Martin Igelfold, University of M�nster</i>. <br><br>Von Igelfeld stared at the page for a moment, his heart a cold stone within him. It was immediately clear to him what had happened. They thought that he was Professor Igelfold, Dean of Veterinary Medicine at M�nster. Von Igelfeld knew of Igelfold's existence, as he had seen the remarkably similar name in the newspaper during an anthrax scare. But he had never dreamed that there would be confusion on such a heroic scale! Those foolish, bumbling people at the <i>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</i> had mixed them up and sent him off to lecture on veterinary medicine in Arkansas! It was a situation of such terrible embarrassment that for a moment he hardly dared contemplate it. And the lecture was about to begin, before all these people--these expectant scientists, veterinarians and dog breeders--and he had proposed to talk about modal verbs in the writings of Fernando Pessoa. <br><br>Almost without thinking, he signed the pamphlet and returned it to the other man. <br><br>'We're so honoured to have you here in Fayetteville,' said the man. 'We understand that you are the world authority on the sausage dog. We are looking forward to what you have to say to us tonight. Sausage dogs are quite popular here. German settlers brought them with them in the late eighteen nineties and we have bred them ever since.' <br><br>Von Igelfeld stared at him in horror. Sausage dogs! He was expected to talk about sausage dogs, a subject on which he knew absolutely nothing. It was a nightmare; like one of those dreams where you imagine that you are about to take the lead part in a Greek play or where you are sitting down to write an examination in advanced calculus. But he was awake, and it was really happening. <br><br>Leflar was at his side now. <br><br>'Almost time,' he said. 'Should I ask people to move into the hall?' <br><br>'Not yet,' said von Igelfeld, looking about him desperately. 'I have so many colleagues yet to meet.' <br><br>He detached himself from Leflar and made his way over to a knot of people standing near the door. This proved to be a group of veterinary surgeons who welcomed him to their circle and refilled his glass from a bottle of wine which one of them was holding. <br><br>It was in this group that one of the guests drew him aside and engaged him in distinctly unsettling conversation. <br><br>'I was sorry to read about your death,' said the guest. <br><br>Von Igelfeld looked at him in astonishment. <br><br>'My death?' <br><br>'Yes,' said the guest. 'There was a small item in the <i>International Veterinary Review</i> this week reporting the very recent death of Professor Igelfold. There was a glowing obituary.' <br><br>Von Igelfeld stared glassily at the man before him, who was surveying him over his drink. <br><br>'I did not read it,' he said weakly. <br><br>'Not surprising,' said the man. 'One rarely has the pleasure of reading one's own obituary.' <br><br>Von Igelfeld laughed, mopping his brow with his handkerchief. <br><br>'Very amusing,' he said. 'And you are so right!' <br><br>'So this <i>is</i> a posthumous lecture,' said the man. <br><br>'Well,' said von Igelfeld. 'It would appear to be something of that sort.' <br><br>The man looked pensive. 'I must say that you don't look at all like your photograph. They published one with the obituary, you know.' <br><br>Von Igelfeld gripped the stem of his glass. 'The camera is often deceptive, I find.' <br><br>'You were a smaller man in the photograph,' went on the other. 'Not nearly so tall.' <br><br>'I see,' said von Igelfeld icily. 'A smaller photograph, perhaps? Anyway, do you not know that in Germany we sometimes publish obituaries <i>before</i> a person's demise. It happens quite often.

RUMKOWSKI AND THE ORPHANS OF &#x141;�D&#x179; is a chilling account of a young woman's experiences in the notorious &#x141;�d&#x17a; Ghetto. The ghetto was lorded over by Chaim Rumkowski, Nazi-appointed Jewish Elder of &#x141;�d&#x17a; and former head of the orphanage. Many have long hailed Rumkowski as a hero who did the best he could leading his community through the worst of circumstances. Now Lucille Eichengreen shares, with firsthand evidence, how Chaim Rumkowski flouted his authority through collaboration, corruption, and the abuse of its children.</p><p>Lucille Eichengreen was born Cecilia Landau in Hamburg, Germany, in 1925. A survivor of the &#x141;�d&#x17a; Ghetto and Auschwitz, Neuengamme, and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, she came to New York in 1946. Now retired and living in Berkeley, California, she writes and speaks on the Holocaust at schools and universities.Eichengreen (From Ashes to Life, 1994) and Camhi Fromer (The House By the Sea, 1998) are individually responsible for two of the better recent Holocaust books; what would happen if they collaborated? Eichengreen returns to the story of her own life in this volume, elaborating on one of the worst periods of the war years as she recalls the experience of the Lodz ghetto, with particular attention to Chaim Rumkowski, the Nazi-appointed ``Elder'' of the ghetto. Rumkowski was the head of a major Jewish orphanage before the outbreak of war and, as the 16-year-old Eichengreen quickly learned from friends in the ghetto, had used his position to sexually abuse several of the children in his care. Confined with thousands of other Jews in the increasingly unhealthy, overcrowded, and grim ghetto, living in a small apartment with a half-dozen people, Eichengreen struggles to survive on the woefully inadequate food rations. Her mother dies, virtually from starvation, and her younger sister becomes increasingly listless from hunger and the emotional brutality of their circumstances, eventually being taken away on one of the many transports to the death camps. Left alone, Eichengreen finally meets the feared and loathed Rumkowski face to face, and finds herself added to a list of his potential ``conquests.'' What makes this story almost unbearable reading is the idea that people who are suffering such great deprivation and abuse should be subjected to a final humiliation. As Eichengreen says, ``We had all become accustomed to the privation in the ghetto, but [Rumkowski] was insufferable.'' Regrettably, despite their previous track records, Eichengreen and Camhi Fromer fall short of their previous work here. The writing is turgid and overheated; the reported dialogue all sounds like the work of a B movie writeralthough Camhi Fromer's Afterword is useful and well-written, putting the history of the ghettoes into a larger context. Important as an illustration of the corruption and heartlessness of those Jews who willingly helped the Nazis, but disappointing as a work of literature or historical writing. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It comes from a garden bursting with life, color, sounds, smells, sunshine, moisture, birds, and bees! Healthy food becomes much more interesting when children know where they come from. So what s in the garden? Kids will find a variety fruits and vegetables, and a tasty, kid-friendly recipe for each one to start a lifetime of good eating. A <em>food for thought</em> section presents interesting facts about each fruit and vegetable, and a <em>how does your garden grow?</em> section explains facts about gardening and the parts of plants.</p><p>K-Gr 2-Rhythmic poetry gives one-page clues that answer the title question. "It's round. It's tiny. It grows on a bush./When made into sauce, it turns to a mush./This fabulous fruit can be used as a dye,/And is really yummy in muffins and pie." The fresh fruits and vegetables revealed by turning the page are celebrated in vibrant full-color illustrations. Birds and insects also populate these gardens-a slug on celery leaves, a ladybug alighting on a tomato stem in pursuit of aphids, and a crow circling corn plants. Very, very close-up, realistic illustrations show children thoroughly enjoying the garden's bounty-saliva drips onto an apple being crunched, lettuce sticks out of an African American boy's teeth, broccoli drenched in dip fills the mouth of an Asian American boy. There's a recipe for each fruit or vegetable-e.g., garlic mashed potatoes, blueberry pie, and ants on a log. Less-than-precise editing mars some of the recipes, e.g., four cups of peeled potatoes probably should be four potatoes; roasting pumpkin seeds is a lot messier than the recipe lets on, as is creating a lattice top on the blueberry pie. Better editing would also have caught the missing apostrophe in the carrot poem. Four pages for adults are filled with ideas for using the book with children.-Frances E.

A four-line rhyme poses a question, and the next page provides the answer along with a boxed recipe and an illustration of a child preparing or eating it. For example: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s usually brown, way down in the soil. / You scrub it to bake it, or peel it to boil. / It doesn&#x2019;t have ears, but does have eyes&#x2014; / It&#x2019;s really a favorite when mashed or as &#x2018;fries.&#x2019;&#x201d; (The recipe that follows is for Garlic Mashed Potatoes.) The realistic, brightly colored paintings depict multicultural children (many missing baby teeth) and use icons for each ingredient.

The story was first produced in 1930, and Charles Osborne has done little to it except string the dialogue and stage directions together in paragraph form. Christie loyalists will welcome and applaud his dedication to the original, but it does seem as though he could have given it a bit more flair. Still, Poirot himself, bumbling Captain Hastings, and obsequious George are all in good form and it is amusing to find them engaged in another adventure, with an interesting assortment of possible murderers, blackmailers, and innocent (if suspicious) bystanders. <p> The novel opens as Poirot receives a summons at his breakfast table from England's premier physicist, Sir Claud Amory. Busy working on a new formula necessary for England's defense in the Second World War, Amory suspects a member of his household of espionage. Of course, by the time Poirot and sidekick Hastings arrive at the scientist's country house, he is suddenly and mysteriously dead. Amory himself turns out to have been not quite nice, and his family, regardless of his scientific efforts, is pretty pleased with the new state of affairs. Still, Poirot manages both to save the more amiable members of the household from themselves and to protect the secrets of the British Empire. The novel is warmly evocative of another time and place and a welcome reminder of vintage Christie. <i>--K.A.

Halleck, commander of Union forces in the Western Theater, reported to Washington that "Richmond and Corinth are now the great strategical points of war, and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards." In the same vein, Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard declared to Richmond that "If defeated at Corinth, we lose the Mississippi Valley and probably our cause." Those were odd sentiments concerning a town scarcely a decade old. By this time, however, it sat at the junction of the South's two most important rail lines and had become a major strategic locale. <br><br>Despite its significance, Corinth has received comparatively little attention from Civil War historians and has been largely overshadowed by events at Shiloh, Antietam, and Perryville. Timothy Smith's panoramic and vividly detailed new look at Corinth corrects that neglect, focusing on the nearly year-long campaign that opened the way to Vicksburg and presaged the Confederacy's defeat in the West.<br><br>Combining big-picture strategic and operational analysis with ground-level views, Smith covers the spring siege, the vicious attacks and counterattacks of the October battle, and the subsequent occupation. He has drawn extensively on hundreds of eyewitness accounts to capture the sights, sounds, and smells of battle and highlight the command decisions of Halleck, Beauregard, Ulysses S. Grant, Sterling Price, William S. Rosecrans, and Earl Van Dorn.<br><br>This is also the first in-depth examination of Corinth following the creation of a new National Park Service center located at the site. Weaving together an immensely compelling tale that places the reader in the midst of war's maelstrom, it substantially revises and enlarges our understanding of Corinth and its crucial importance in the Civil War.</p><p>Timothy B.

As Ruth Brandon points out in the preface to her marvelous <i>Surreal Lives</i>, <i>surrealism</i> has passed into everyday life as a byword for the strange. However, as this wonderfully exhaustive book point outs, the intellectual and political drive behind the movement was in fact highly revolutionary. What Brandon proceeds to unfold is a kaleidoscopic cultural history of the movement, which by 1924 had self-consciously adopted the title "surrealism," from its emergence in the midst of the ashes of interwar Zurich dada to its enforced relocation to New York in the 1940s. Along the way <i>Surreal Lives</i> deftly weaves a fascinating account of the cultural, artistic, political, personal, and sexual dynamics of the men and women who defined the movement from the 1920s onward.<p> The personal and artistic connections between the usual suspects of Apollinaire, Picabia, Man Ray, Duchamp, Bu�uel, and Dal� are all traced in extensive and highly entertaining detail. And at the book's center lies the pompous, autocratic, charismatic figure of Andr� Breton and his creative but highly volatile relations with the entire cast--from his feuds with Tristan Tzara to his ultimate disillusion with Dal�. Following Breton's enigmatic career, the book moves beautifully between the revolutionary aspirations of the movement and the endemic literary squabbles that often blunted its radicalism. Brandon is particularly successful at uncovering the importance of the various women who had such a decisive impact upon the development of surrealism, as well as offering a range of salacious and often wonderfully incongruous encounters, such as the aged Erik Satie's involvement in the creation of Marcel Duchamp's <i>The Gift</i>. How surreal. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Brandon (The Life and Many Deaths of Harry Houdini, 1994, etc.), a prominent biographer and fiction writer, explores the aesthetics, politics, and psychology of Surrealism by unraveling the complex personal histories of the movement's key players. Among multiple sources of Surrealism, Brandon highlights two: Marxism and Freudianism. Born of the turmoil of WWI and christened by Apollinaire, this revolutionary artistic trend advocated anarchy, sided with the political left during the interwar period, and aspired to produce an iconoclastic ``anti-art.'' A creative use of dreams, delving into the subconscious, and a preoccupation with sex, death, and excrement complemented the Surrealists' political radicalism. Although nowadays we associate Surrealism primarily with visual art, literary figures like the autocratic Andr Breton headed the movement at its inception. Transgression of boundaries between different artistic media was quite common, and many artists also wrote poetry or prose. After the shock induced by Buuel's films, cinematography advanced as the most immediate Surrealist format. Brandon systematically points out the eccentricities that shaped Surrealists' lives and, consequently, their creative process. Despising conventional moral and family values and considering procreation ``sloppy'' at best, many Surrealists were involved in mnages ... trois, bisexual relations, and unscrupulous leeching off rich American lovers. On the other hand, Elsa Triolet and Gala Eluard successfully exploited their husbands' talents to attain the lifestyle they desired. Elsa made Louis Aragon a national icon and had him endorse her writing; the ``nymphomaniacal harpy'' Gala achieved fame and wealth by transforming (her second husband) Dal's originally subversive art into expensive commercial entertainment, compliant with the Fascist regimes in Spain and Germany. Scattering its principles by the wayside, the Surrealist movement stumbled toward its zenith, torn by internal contradictions. Rooted to a large extent in neurotic obsessions, pathological tendencies, and introspective observation, Surrealism is a rare case where insights into artists' lives facilitate interpretation of their creations. A marvelous job of using biographical material to demystify esoteric art. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Novelist and essayist Wilfrid Sheed describes his childhood in the Catholic literary establishment; we are treated to intimate, candid glimpses of the greats, for example, Ronald Knox, G. K. Chesterton and other classic apologists for the faith who were familiars in the peripatetic Sheeds' households. The marriage of Maisie, of the distinguished English Wards, and Frank, a galvanic Australian, produced not only children and a publishing house but stamped a Catholic intellectual formation that still bears fruit. Sheed's graceful, acerbic tribute to his unique parents is a rueful, loving appreciation of a father who remains "my editor, even in death" and of a mother who made "other people's conventional twentieth-century mothers seem awfully dull by comparison." Brimming with anecdotes, songs, hilarity and sadness, the memoir has resonance. BOMC alternate. Foreign rights: ICM/Lynn Nesbit.

In his own day, he was most celebrated for his <em>Vedute</em>, 137 etchings of ancient and modern Rome; so renowned were these startling and dramatic chiaroscuro images, imbued with Piranesi&#x2019;s romantic feeling for archaeological ruins, that they formed the mental picture of Rome for generations after. Indeed, Piranesi could be said to have shaped a whole strain of contemporary architecture, as well as the wider visualization of antiquity itself. In our time, he has had a direct influence on writers such as <strong>Borges</strong> and <strong>Kafka</strong> and on filmmakers such as <strong>Terry Gilliam</strong> and <strong>Peter Greenaway</strong>. Anyone who contemplates Piranesi&#x2019;s etchings will confront the existential nightmare of human existence and its infinite mysteries. &nbsp; Text in English, French, and German</p><p>Luigi Ficacci studied art history in Rome under Giulio Carlo Argan.

His first effort, "The Hunt for Red October," sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the bestseller list after President Ronald Reagan pronounced it "the perfect yarn." Clancy was the undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He died in October 2013. <br> Mark Greaney has a degree in international relations and political science. With Tom Clancy he is the coauthor of "Locked On, Threat Vector, Command Authority, "and "Support and Defend. "He has written four books in his own Gray Man series: "The Gray Man, On Target, Ballistic, "and "Dead Eye. "In his research for these novels, he traveled to more than fifteen countries and trained alongside military and law enforcement in the use of firearms, battlefield medicine and close-range combat tactics.<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>John Clark didn&#x2019;t give a damn what anybody said&#x2014;this was still Saigon.</p><p>He knew history, of course. Forty years ago the communists came down from the north and they took the place. They renamed it Ho Chi Minh City in honor of their conquering leader. To the victors the spoils. They executed collaborators and imprisoned unreliables and they changed the politics, the culture, and the fabric of the lives of those who lived here.</p><p>It looked a little different now, but to John it felt the same. The cloying evening heat and the smell of exhaust fumes mixing with the pressing jungle, the incense and cigarette smoke and the spiced meat, the buzz of the stifling crowds and the lights from the energetic streets.</p><p>And the sense of pervasive danger, just out of sight but closing, like an invading army.</p><p>They could name this city after his sworn enemy from the past, they could call it whatever the hell they wanted, but to the sixty-six-year-old man sitting in the open-front caf� in District 8, that didn&#x2019;t change a thing.</p><p>This was still <i>fucking</i> Saigon.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Clark sat with his legs crossed, his shirt collar open, and his tan tropic-weight sport coat lying across the chair next to him because the slow-moving palm-frond fan above him did nothing more than churn the hot air. Younger men and women swirled around him, heading either to tables in the back or out onto the busy pavement in front of the caf�, but Clark sat still as stone.</p><p>Except for his eyes; his eyes darted back and forth, scanning the street.</p><p>He was struck by the lack of Americans in uniform, the one big disconnect from his memories of old Saigon. Forty-odd years ago he&#x2019;d trod these streets in olive drab or jungle camo. Even when he was here in country with the CIA&#x2019;s MACV-SOG (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam&#x2014;Studies and Observations Group), he&#x2019;d rarely worn civilian clothing. He was a Navy SEAL, there was a war going on, battle dress was appropriate for an American, even one in country working direct-action ops for the Agency.</p><p>Also missing were the bicycles. Back then ninety percent of the wheeled traffic on this street would have been bikes. Today there were some bikes, sure, but mostly it was scooters and motorcycles and small cars filling the street, with pedestrian throngs covering the sidewalks.</p><p>And nobody wore a uniform around here.</p><p>He took a sip of green tea in the glow of the votive candle flickering on his bistro table. He didn&#x2019;t care for the tea, but this place didn&#x2019;t have beer or even wine. What it <i>did</i> have was line of sight on the Lion d&#x2019;Or, a large French colonial restaurant, just across Huynh Thi Phung Street. He looked away from the passersby, stopped thinking about the days when twenty-five percent of them would have been U.S. military, and he glanced back to the Lion d&#x2019;Or. As hard as it was to divorce himself from the past, he managed to put the war out of his mind, because this evening his task was the man drinking alone at a corner table in the restaurant, just twenty-five yards from where Clark sat.</p><p>The subject of Clark&#x2019;s surveillance was American, a few years younger than Clark, bald and thickly built. To Clark it was clear this man seemed to be having issues this evening. His jaw was fixed in anger, his body movements were jolting and exaggerated like a man nearly overcome with fury.</p><p>Clark could relate. He was in a particularly foul humor himself.</p><p>He watched the subject for another moment, then checked his watch and pressed down on a button on a small wireless controller in his left hand. He spoke aloud, albeit softly, even though no one sat close by. &#x201c;One-hour mark. Whoever he&#x2019;s meeting is making him wait for the honor of their company.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Three stories above and directly behind Clark&#x2014;on the roof of a mixed-use colonial-style office building&#x2014;three men, all lying prone and wearing muted colors and black backpacks, scanned the street below them. They were connected to Clark via their earbuds, and they&#x2019;d picked up his transmission.</p><p>Domingo &#x201c;Ding&#x201d; Chavez, in the middle of the three, centered his Nikon on the man in the restaurant and focused the lens. Then he pressed his own push-to-talk button and answered back softly: &#x201c;Subject is not a happy camper. Looks like he&#x2019;s about to put his fist through the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>Clark replied from below. &#x201c;If I have to sit here in this heat and sip this disgusting tea much longer, I&#x2019;m going to do the same.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez cleared his throat uncomfortably, then said, &#x201c;Uh, it&#x2019;s not too bad up here. How about one of us take the eye at ground level, you can make your way to the roof?&#x201d;</p><p>The reply came quick. &#x201c;Negative. Hold positions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d;</p><p>Sam Driscoll chuckled. He lay on Chavez&#x2019;s left, just a few feet away, his eye to a spotting scope that he used to scan to the north of the restaurant, watching the road for any sign of trouble. He spoke to the men around him, but he didn&#x2019;t transmit. &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s grumpy.&#x201d;</p><p>Several yards to Chavez&#x2019;s right, Jack Ryan, Jr., peered through his camera, scanning the pedestrians on the sidewalk to the south of their overwatch. He focused his attention on a leggy blonde climbing out of a cab. While doing so he asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Clark? He&#x2019;s usually the last one of us to bitch, but he&#x2019;s been like this all day.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no one else on this rooftop other than the three Americans, but Chavez had been doing this sort of thing for most of his adult life. He knew his voice would carry through the metal air-conditioning duct behind him if he wasn&#x2019;t careful, so he answered back as if he were in a library. &#x201c;Mr. C&#x2019;s got some history around here, is all. Probably coming back to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Ryan said. &#x201c;He must be reliving the war.&#x201d;</p><p>Ding smiled in the darkness. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of it. Clark&#x2019;s down in that caf� thinking about the shit he saw. The shit he did. But he&#x2019;s also thinking about running around here as a twenty-five-year-old SEAL stud. It probably scares him how much he wishes he was back in the groove. War or no war.&#x201d;</p><p>Ryan said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s holding up for an old guy. We should all be so lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>Driscoll shifted on his belly to find a more comfortable position on the asphalt mansard roof, though he kept his eye in his optic, centering now on the man at the table. &#x201c;Clark&#x2019;s right. It doesn&#x2019;t look like this meet is going to happen, and watching this guy through a ten-power scope while he drinks his liver into oblivion is getting old.&#x201d;</p><p>While Sam focused on the subject, Ryan continued following the blonde as she pushed through the foot traffic heading north along Huynh Thi Phung Street. He tracked her to the front door of Lion d&#x2019;Or. &#x201c;Good news. I think our evening just got interesting.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez followed Ryan&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;Really? How so?&#x201d;</p><p>Jack watched the woman as she turned sharply into the restaurant from the sidewalk and moved directly toward their subject&#x2019;s table. &#x201c;The meet has arrived, and <i>she</i> is hot.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez saw her through his own binos now. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s better than watching another fat dude slurp gin.&#x201d; He pressed the push-to-talk button again. &#x201c;John, we&#x2019;ve got a&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Clark&#x2019;s voice crackled over Chavez, because he had the command unit on their network and could override other transmissions. &#x201c;I see her. Too bad we don&#x2019;t have any fucking audio.&#x201d;</p><p>The men on the roof all laughed nervously. Damn, Clark <i>was</i> grouchy tonight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1</p><p>Colin Hazelton made a show of checking the time on his mobile phone as the woman sat down. She was an hour late and he wanted to indicate his displeasure, even if only passive-aggressively.</p><p>She fixed the hem of her skirt and crossed her legs, and only then did she look up at him. She seemed to notice the phone and his focus on it, then she lifted the sweating water glass in front of her and took a sip.</p><p>Hazelton dropped his phone back into his pocket and drank down half of his gin and tonic. He had to admit she was every bit as attractive as advertised. It was virtually all his control had said about his contact tonight. Statuesque and blond, with mannerisms that transmitted refinement and poise. Still, Hazelton was too pissed to be impressed. Not pissed at her, exclusively, but generally angry, and he certainly wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to ogle his contact tonight.</p><p>That she&#x2019;d made him wait a goddamned hour took even more of the luster off her splendor.</p><p>Before either spoke the waiter appeared. It was that kind of place, not like the dive bars and tea shops that populated the rest of this part of Huynh Thi Phung Street.</p><p>The woman ordered a glass of white wine in perfect French. Hazelton could tell it was her native tongue, but his control officer had mentioned this fact as well, between breathless comments about her almond eyes and her lithe body.</p><p>He assumed she was a former French spook, either DGSE or DCRI, although she also could have been from DST, which became DCRI in 2008. Virtually everyone Hazelton met with in the course of his work was a former intelligence officer, so this was no stretch.</p><p>She did not introduce herself, though he wasn&#x2019;t surprised by this. He had, however, expected some contrition for her late arrival. But she didn&#x2019;t mention it at all. Instead, she opened with, &#x201c;You brought the documents?&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton did not answer her directly. &#x201c;What do you know about the circumstances of the operation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The circumstances?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The client. Have they read you in on the client?&#x201d;</p><p>She showed a little confusion now. &#x201c;Why would they do that? The client is not relevant to my brief.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, let me fill you in. The client is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The woman held a slender hand up. Her nails were perfectly manicured, and her skin glowed with lotion. &#x201c;When they don&#x2019;t brief me, I take that to mean I am not supposed to know.&#x201d; She looked Hazelton over. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t appear to be new to this work, so surely you understand this.&#x201d; Her French accent was thick, but her English was flawless.</p><p>He took another gulp of gin. &#x201c;Sometimes it&#x2019;s best to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps that is your philosophy. It is not mine.&#x201d; She said it with an air of finality. She wanted to move on. &#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you have them or not?&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton spoke slowly and softly, but stressing every word through a slur from the alcohol he&#x2019;d been consuming all day, both here and in the lobby bar back at his hotel. <i>&#x201c;North&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fucking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Korea.&#x201d;</i></p><p>No response from the Frenchwoman.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;You <i>did</i> know, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>She did not answer. Instead, she replied, &#x201c;You are very emotional, aren&#x2019;t you? This surprises me. I know you were given a rush assignment, someone took ill and they pulled out and then you were called over, but New York should know better than to send in an emotional traveling officer.&#x201d; Below the table, Hazelton felt the tip of her high-heeled shoe as it ran along his leg, just next to his ankle. There was a time in his life when this would have excited him, but that was long ago. This was work; he knew she was just feeling around to see if he had a briefcase. Soon he heard her toe thump his case, next to his leg.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Slide it to me, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The big American just sat there. He drummed his fingers on the table. Considering.</p><p>He expected to see frustration on her face, but she was oddly cool about his delay. After several seconds she repeated herself with no change in tone. &#x201c;Slide it to me, please.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know what he was going to do tonight. Would he pass the items or shred them and dump them in a river like fish food? The ramifications for each course of action had been weighing on him all day. But now a sense of composure came over him, and he heard himself say, &#x201c;You know what? I didn&#x2019;t sign on to this job to be an errand boy for a bunch of murdering psychos.&#x201d; Then, &#x201c;There is other work to be had without stooping this low.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; the woman said, and while speaking she glanced into the street, a casual gaze. She looked bored, but Hazelton knew she was simply keeping an eye out for surveillance.</p><p>Hazelton waved his arm in the air angrily. &#x201c;To hell with this. I&#x2019;m out.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman, by contrast, displayed no emotion. <i>&#x201c;Out?&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not passing the documents on to you.&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed a little now. &#x201c;Is this about money? If so, you will need to talk to New York. I have no authorization to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about money. It&#x2019;s about good and evil. That&#x2019;s completely lost on you, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My job has nothing to do with either.&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton looked at the woman with complete derision. His decision had been made. &#x201c;Tell yourself that if you need to, but you&#x2019;re <i>not</i> getting these docs.&#x201d; He kicked the briefcase loud enough for her to hear it.</p><p>The woman nodded. A countenance of calm. Her detachment was odd to Hazelton. He&#x2019;d expected screaming and yelling. She just said, &#x201c;This will complicate things. New York will be angry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Screw New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t expect me to join you in your moral crusade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doll, I don&#x2019;t give a damn what you do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you won&#x2019;t give a damn when I walk out of here and make a phone call.&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton paused, the strain of his work and the travel evident on his face. &#x201c;Call him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He will send someone to take that case from you.&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton smiled now. &#x201c;He might try. But like you said, I&#x2019;m not exactly new at this. I have a few tricks up my sleeve.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For your sake, I hope you do.&#x201d; The Frenchwoman stood and turned away, passing the smiling waiter approaching the table with the wine on a silver tray.</p></p><h2>Spycatcher</h2><p>Acceptable quality.

Drawn to the public beach for its less-than-glamorous reputation, photographer Wayne Lawrence felt a connection to the community as soon as he began snapping pictures. His glamorous portraits of proud men and women, loving couples, and families at play challenge stereotypes associated with working-class people by focusing on universal themes such as the ties that bind and cultural pride. Whether Anglo, African American, or Latino; statuesque or stout; young or old, each individual is treated with dignity and sensitivity.

In the four main sections of the book, Stein tells the stories of the mathematical thinkers who discerned some of the most fundamental aspects of our universe. From their successes and failures, delusions, and even duels, the trajectories of their innovations&#x2014;and their impact on society&#x2014;are traced in this fascinating narrative. Quantum mechanics, space-time, chaos theory and the workings of complex systems, and the impossibility of a "perfect" democracy are all here. Stein's book is both mind-bending and practical, as he explains the best way for a salesman to plan a trip, examines why any thought you could have is imbedded in the number &#x3c0; , and&#x2014;perhaps most importantly&#x2014;answers one of the modern world's toughest questions: why the garage can never get your car repaired on time.</p><p>Friendly, entertaining, and fun, <em>How Math Explains the World</em> is the first book by one of California's most popular math teachers, a veteran of both "math for poets" and Princeton's Institute for Advanced Studies. And it's perfect for any reader wanting to know how math makes both science and the world tick.</p></p><p><p>James D. Stein is a professor of mathematics at California State University, Long Beach. A graduate of Yale University and the University of California, Berkeley, he lives in Redondo Beach, California. </p>Stein, a mathematics professor at California State University, explores the application of math to problem solving in the everyday, explaining tricky concepts and developing elegant algorithms for everything from scheduling auto repair to organizing a closet. He also demonstrates the power of the solution: "We advance, both as individuals and as a species, by solving problems. As a rule of thumb, the reward for solving problems increases with the difficulty." Stein blends math history and complex theories with jokes in a seamless manner while looking into everything from quantum mechanics to voting, while still realizing the limitations of his field-"without experiments and measurement these tools mathetmatics are essentially useless"-and its more whimsical possibilities: "We do not yet have the mathematical objects needed to discuss art, or beauty, or love; but that does not mean that they do not exist." Stein's work, mathematically rigorous but with minimal equations, will appeal to both casual and serious fans of math or physics, as well as those who take keen interest in problem solving. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was born in Vienna, immigrating to Palestine when a child in 1933. He was for long considered one of Israel&#39;s leading journalists. Never a mere votary of Zionism, he finally moved to Tuscany when his disillusionment became closer to despair. Inevitably branded &#39;a self-hating jew&#39; he once on television snapped at a reactionary accuser, &#39;I don&#39;t hate myself, I just hate Jews like you.&#39; The author of nine books, Faber Finds is reissuing four of them: Founder; The Israelis; Jerusalem and HerzlModern Jerusalem, in Elon's words, is "a breeding ground of ghettos." Israelis and Palestinians continue to work and live apart from one another; the city fissures into four rough quadrangles--Moslem, Jewish, Christian, Armenian--each with its own religion, its distinctive tongue or tongues. In a rich, beautifully written, impartial meditation that is also a healing act, Elon, noted Israeli author and journalist ( Herzl ; The Israelis: Founders and Sons ), measures the clarity of Jerusalem's biblical landscape against a past and present choked with religious and political strife. For a host of pilgrims from Dominican friar Felix Fabri to Mark Twain, Chateaubriand and Gogol, Jerusalem has served as a mirror of faith, despair, hope or disbelief. Elon, a contemporary wanderer through Jerusalem, as well as a long-time resident, sadly finds that the modern city "has almost always been intolerant and exclusivist." <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Beat Literature (Literary Movements)</h2><p>In an accessible A-to-Z format, Encyclopedia of Beat Literature contains hundreds of entries on all the major figures and great works of the Beat movement.

Kennedy, the Warren Commission reported that Lee Harvey Oswald alone, killed the president on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, had no confederates, nor did any foreign power aid him in his deadly deed. Case closed.<br><br>However, what most Americans did not know was that one day after the assassination, the FBI deported a known French assassin, and a member of the militant, anti-Charles de-Gaulle organization the OAS-Jean Souetre-to either Mexico or Canada. Souetre was involved in anti-De Gaulle terrorist activities in Europe and even tried to recruit the CIA in his efforts to oust de Gaulle. During his career, he used at least 11 aliases, including those of two real people. Why was a known French assassin in Dallas, on the exact day that the president of the United States was killed and what role, if any did he play in the monstrous deed? <br><br>This book describes the "French Connection&#x201d; to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in a way that most assassination literature has failed to do. This book tells the story-using documents and other written sources that were not available years ago. The Warren Commission never fully investigated the activities of Jean Souetre, or why he was in Dallas that day.<br><br>The book delves into three major areas of study: the investigation of Jean Souetre and the two other men whose identities he used; the investigation of the identities of two European assassins, QJ/WIN and WI/ROUGE; their use in the CIA's assassination unit called ZR/RIFLE-Executive Action; and the role of the CIA in the drug trade after World War 2.<br><br>This book puts the entire story of the French Connection in historical perspective, as the 50th anniversary of the death of John F.

I call that a dream, so soft and delicious, too.&#39; She rubbed a fold of the skirt against her cheek. &#39;Mine&#39;s silver lame, it smells like a bird cage when it gets hot but I do love it. Aren&#39;t you thankful evening skirts are long again?&#39; Ah, the dresses! But oh, the monotony of the Season, with its endless run of glittering balls. Even fabulously fashionable Polly Hampton - with her startling good looks and excellent social connections - is beginning to wilt under the glare. Groomed for the perfect marriage by her mother, fearsome Lady Montdore, Polly instead scandalises society by declaring her love for her uncle &#39;Boy&#39; Dougdale, the Lecherous Lecturer, and promptly eloping to France. But the consequences of this union no one could quite expect . . . Love in a Cold Climate is the wickedly funny follow-up to The Pursuit of Love. &#39;Entirely original, inimitable and irresistible&#39; Philip Hensher, Spectator Nancy Mitford was the eldest of the infamous Mitford sisters, known for her membership in &#39;The Bright Young Things&#39; clique of the 1920s and an intimate of Evelyn Waugh; she produced witty, satirical novels with a cast of characters taken directly from the aristocratic social scene of which she was a part. Her novels, Wigs on the Green, The Pursuit of Love, The Blessing and Don&#39;t Tell Alfred, are available in single paperback editions from Penguin or as part of The Penguin Complete Novels of Nancy Mitford which also includes Highland Fling, Christmas Pudding and Pigeon Pie. This edition of Love in a Cold Climate is introduced by actor, director and writer Alan Cumming.</p><p>Nancy Mitford (1904-1973) was born in London, the eldest child of the second Baron Redesdale. She had written four novels, including Wigs on the Green (1935), before the success of The Pursuit of Love in 1945, which she followed with Love in a Cold Climate (1949), The Blessing (1951) and Don&#39;t Tell Alfred (1960). She also wrote four works of biography. Nancy Mitford was awarded the CBE in 1972.Chapter 1<br> <br> I am obliged to begin this story with a brief account of the Hampton family, because it is necessary to emphasise the fact once and for all that the Hamptons were very grand as well as very rich. A short session with Burke or with Debrett would be quite enough to make this clear, but these large volumes are not always available, while the books on the subject by Lord Montdore&#x2019;s brother-in-law, Boy Dougdale, are all out of print. His great talent for snobbishness and small talent for literature have produced three detailed studies of his wife&#x2019;s forebears, but they can only be read now by asking a bookseller to get them at second hand. (The bookseller will put an advertisement in his trade paper, <i>The Clique</i>: &#x201c;H. Dougdale, any by.&#x201d; He will be snowed under with copies at about a shilling each and will then proudly inform his customer that he has &#x201c;managed to find what you want,&#x201d; implying hours of careful search on barrows, dirt cheap, at 30/- the three.) <i>Georgiana Lady Montdore and Her Circle</i>, <i>The Magnificent Montdores</i> and <i>Old Chronicles of Hampton</i>, I have them beside me as I write, and see that the opening paragraph of the first is: <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Two ladies, one dark, one fair, both young and lovely, were driving briskly towards the little village of Kensington on a fine May<b> </b>morning. They were Georgiana, Countess of Montdore and her great friend Walburga, Duchess of Paddington, and they made a delightfully animated picture as they discussed the burning question of the hour&#x2014;should one or should one not subscribe to a parting present for poor dear Princess Lieven?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> This book is dedicated, by gracious permission, to Her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess Peter of Russia, and has eight full-page illustrations. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It must be said that when this trilogy first came out it had quite a vogue with the lending-library public. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The family of Hampton is ancient in the West of England, indeed Fuller, in his <i>Worthies </i>mentions it as being of stupendous antiquity.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Burke makes it out just a shade more ancient than does Debrett, but both plunge back into the mists of mediaeval times from which they drag forth ancestors with P. G. Wodehouse names, Ugs and Berts and Threds, and Walter Scott fates. &#x201c;His Lordship was attainted&#x2014;beheaded&#x2014;convicted&#x2014;proscribed&#x2014;exiled&#x2014;dragged from prison by a furious mob&#x2014;slain at the Battle of Cr�cy&#x2014;went down in the White Ship&#x2014;perished during the third crusade&#x2014;killed in a duel.&#x201d; There were very few natural deaths to record in the early misty days. Both Burke and Debrett linger with obvious enjoyment over so genuine an object as this family, unspoilt by the ambiguities of female line and deed poll. Nor could any of those horrid books, which came out in the nineteenth century, devoted to research and aiming to denigrate the nobility, make the object seem less genuine. Tall, golden-haired barons, born in wedlock and all looking very much alike, succeeded each other at Hampton, on lands which had never been bought or sold, generation after generation until, in 1770, the Lord Hampton of the day brought back, from a visit to Versailles, a French bride, a Mademoiselle de Montdore. Their son had brown eyes, a dark skin and presumably, for it is powdered in all the pictures of him, black hair. This blackness did not persist in the family. He married a golden-haired heiress from Derbyshire, and the Hamptons reverted to their blue-and-gold looks, for which they are famous to this day. The son of the Frenchwoman was rather clever and very worldly; he dabbled in politics and wrote a book of aphorisms, but his chief claim to fame was his great and lifelong friendship with the Regent, which procured him, among other favours, an earldom. His mother&#x2019;s family having all perished during the Terror in France, he took her name as his title. Enormously rich, he spent enormously; he had a taste for French objects of art and acquired, during the years which followed the Revolution, a splendid collection of such things, including many pieces from the royal establishments, and others which had been looted out of the Hotel de Montdore in the rue de Varenne. To make a suitable setting for this collection, he then proceeded to pull down at Hampton the large plain house that Adam had built for his grandfather and to drag over to England stone by stone (as modern American millionaires are supposed to do) a Gothic French chateau. This he assembled round a splendid tower of his own designing, covered the walls of the rooms with French panelling and silks and set it in a formal landscape which he also designed and planted himself. It was all very grand and very mad, and in the between wars period of which I write, very much out of fashion. &#x201c;I suppose it is beautiful,&#x201d; people used to say, &#x201c;but frankly I don&#x2019;t admire it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> This Lord Montdore also built Montdore House in Park Lane and a castle on a crag in Aberdeenshire. He was really much the most interesting and original character the family produced, but no member of it deviated from a tradition of authority. A solid, worthy, powerful Hampton can be found on every page of English history, his influence enormous in the West of England and his counsels not unheeded in London.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tradition was carried on by the father of my friend, Polly Hampton. If an Englishman could be descended from the gods it would be he, so much the very type of English nobleman that those who believed in aristocratic government would always begin by pointing to him as a justification of their argument. It was generally felt, indeed, that if there were more people like him the country would not be in its present mess, even Socialists conceding his excellence, which they could afford to do since there was only one of him and he was getting on. A scholar, a Christian, a gentleman, finest shot in the British Isles, best-looking Viceroy we ever sent to India, a popular landlord, a pillar of the Conservative Party, a wonderful old man, in short, who nothing common ever did or mean. My cousin Linda and I, two irreverent little girls whose opinion makes no odds, used to think that he was a wonderful old fraud, and it seemed to us that in that house it was Lady Montdore who really counted. Now Lady Montdore was forever doing common things and mean, and she was intensely unpopular, quite as much disliked as her husband was loved, so that anything he might do that was considered not quite worthy of him, or which did not quite fit in with his reputation, was immediately laid at her door. &#x201c;Of course she made him do it.&#x201d; On the other hand, I have often wondered whether without her to bully him and push him forward and plot and intrigue for him and &#x201c;make him do it,&#x201d; whether, in fact, without the help of those very attributes which caused her to be so much disliked, her thick skin and ambition and boundless driving energy, he would ever have done anything at all noteworthy in the world.</p><h2>The Ancient Mariners (SEAFARERS)</h2><p>Surveys the various seafarers of the ancient world, including Greece and Rome, their ships, trade, and battles at sea</p><p></p><h2>Travels and Other Writings (Classic, Nature, Penguin)</h2><p>This classic narrative of travels through America&#39;s southern wilderness was first published in 1791 by botanist William Bartram.

Goldbarth's ample output, frequently comic effects, reader-friendly free verse and almost dauntingly omnivorous reference&#x2014;from Roman history to cardiology to 1950s science fiction&#x2014;have slowed down what might otherwise be the widespread acknowledgment of an American master: that has started to change (he won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2002) and might change further with this 25th book of verse. Here is my shtick/ and my stump-speech exhortation to you, delivered in spittle/ and neural knot-ways, part of a seven-page poem that advises, again and again, Keep a dream journal. Elsewhere is a five-part poem that seeks, through facts from William Carlos Williams's biography, modern cosmology and 19th-century typesetting, the mysteries of whatever/ you call it, animus, or consciousness&#x2014;the 'soul.'�&nbsp; The sciences, The Writing Life and Everything make repeated appearances in Goldbarth's fast-paced lines. Yet for all his oddball flights, all his waggly buggish-visaged aliens and the like, Goldbarth returns, most of the time, to first and last things&#x2014;to why some marriages (his own, for example) last: to how we deal with parents and friends who fall ill; to how we get all we can, and more than we know, out of life and out of death. <i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It should have been the ideal existence for Hiffy, her fondest dream fulfilled, but instead the young captain's increasingly hard-pressed to take care of her ship's business.<br> So when Meetpoint's stationmaster offers her a million credits to transport a small, mysterious, "religious" object it seems like a golden opportunity&#x2014;perhaps even too good an opportunity....

Cherryh </b>planned to write since the age of ten. When she was older, she learned to use a type writer while triple-majoring in Classics, Latin and Greek. At 33, she signed over her first three books to DAW and has worked with DAW ever since. She can be found at cherryh.com.Fifth in Cherryh's hitherto paperback Chanur series--a clan/dynasty saga whose alien principals, unusually, are nearly all female, and featuring other alien species by the shipload amid a welter of interspecies politicking, maneuvering, haggling, and strife. Hilfy Chanur of the catlike alien ``hani,'' head of the Chanur clan, is captain of the ship Chanur's Legacy, having been appointed by her enormously influential alien-ambassador aunt Pyanfar. Tempted by the offer of a million credits, Hilfy accepts a peculiar and complicated commission from the powerful alien ``stsho'' station chief of Meetingpoint--to deliver a mysterious ``Preciousness'' to another stsho at Urtur. She also acquires, unwillingly, a male crew member (all Chanur spacers are female) who got himself into trouble and, suspiciously, was abandoned by his ship (the resulting sexual tensions, reversed from the usual polarity, are splendidly handled). Immediately, Hilfy is approached by yet another alien, a ``mahendo'sat'' named Haisi, who, improbably, insists he's Hilfy's friend but pressures her for information. Still another complication are the warrior-alien ``kif'' who appear to be protecting the stsho station chief, an unlikely alliance that Hilfy mistrusts. And she's haunted by dreams--or are they extrasensory communications?--of her last love, a human named Tully, and her aunt Pyanfar, who's clearly plotting and planning at some remote remove. Complicated enough? Just wait until you hear about the plot... Readers new to Cherryh's Compact Space will need patience and determination to get involved--but it's worth the effort: memorable characters, intriguing aliens, and a convoluted yet satisfying plot guaranteed to extend even the most space-operatically inclined brain cells. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It&#39;s the late 1960s and homosexuality has only just been legalised, and Jeremy Thorpe, the leader of the Liberal party, has a secret he&#39;s desperate to hide. As long as Norman Scott, his beautiful, unstable lover is around, Thorpe&#39;s brilliant career is at risk. With the help of his fellow politicians, Thorpe schemes, deceives, embezzles - until he can see only one way to silence Scott for good. The trial of Jeremy Thorpe changed our society forever: it was the moment the British public discovered the truth about its political class. Illuminating the darkest secrets of the Establishment, the Thorpe affair revealed such breath-taking deceit and corruption in an entire section of British society that, at the time, hardly anyone dared believe it could be true. A Very English Scandal is an eye-opening tale of how the powerful protect their own, and an extraordinary insight into the forces that shaped modern Britain.</p><p>John Preston is a former Arts Editor of the Evening Standard and the Sunday Telegraph.

Preston revives a forgotten era and delves into the personalities behind the headlines. * Times Crime Club * Retold with masterful skill...

Preston is an enthralling narrator * Mail on Sunday * Gripping ... cack-handed assassins, buffoonish policemen, dodgy Home secretaries and sozzled judges.

Its aim is to inspire readers to weigh the historical evidence. At the end of the Second World War, the first unified German state collapsed, a disintegration with European and global ramifications. Ever since, historians have sought to explain what went wrong in German history. Many have focused on the violence which forged unification; others have highlighted the clash of authoritarian, anti-democratic, and anti-Semitic traditions with rapid industrialization and modernization. Germany, 1871-1945 presents a pragmatic interpretation of German history, from the unification to the end of the Nazi regime. This more open approach acknowledges the strong trend in German society towards modernization and democratization, particularly before 1914, while also highlighting the factors which propelled Germany toward World War I. The rise of the Nazis also demands a close analysis of the economic and political instability of the 1920s and early 1930s. Finally, a detailed assessment of the Third Reich explains how the regime&#39;s early successes fostered a loyalty and acceptance that remained hard to shake until disaster was obvious and unavoidable.</p><p>Raffael Scheck is Professor of the History Department, Colby College, and is the author of Alfred von Tirpitz and German Right-Wing Politics, 1914-1930 (1998), Mothers of the Nation (2004), and Hitler&#39;s African Victims (2006; pbk. 2008).Raffael Scheck has provided us with a competent, well written, and accessible textbook. In covering the whole period between 1871 and 1945 and focusing on an enlightened political history it will be very useful to undergraduates as well as general readers. Moritz Follmer, University of Leeds This is an interesting and generally balanced account of a crucial period in German history. The book is characterized by smooth-flowing, quite accessible narrative. Unusual in a work of this sort, the author on occasion effectively weaves his own experiences and his family history into the narrative.

Karen published her first novel at age twenty-four and has won multiple awards throughout her career, including six Silver Pens for favorite author. Karen was described by <i>The Daily Mail</i> as &#x201c;one of the most reliable thriller...writers in the world.&#x201d; She is the mother of three boys and lives in Louisville, Kentucky.Shiver <br>CHAPTER ONE<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, I&#x2019;m scared.&#x201d; Tyler&#x2019;s voice was scarcely louder than a whisper. Curled up in his bed with one arm wrapped around his favorite stuffed bear and the other tucked beneath his head, he was a small, thin boy who hardly made a dent in the covers. His black hair was still damp from the bath she had made him take just before getting into bed and smelled, just faintly, of baby shampoo. The expression in his blue eyes proclaimed his absolute conviction that she could keep him safe from all harm. Samantha Jones looked down at her four-year-old son and felt a pang in the region of her heart. She was a twenty-three-year-old single mother with a precarious job situation, very little money, and absolutely no experience raising kids, and she was all he had.<br> <br>Probably she wasn&#x2019;t going to get mother of the year anytime soon, but she was doing her best.<br> <br>&#x201c;Close your eyes and go to sleep, and I&#x2019;ll be home before you wake up,&#x201d; she promised. Like Tyler, she was slim and fine-boned, with unruly black hair&#x2014;hers reached the middle of her back&#x2014;and blue eyes. She sat beside him on his twin bed in the pool of lamplight cast by the room&#x2019;s only illumination, the small red lamp on the nightstand. Her back rested against a pillow tucked against the headboard and her knees were bent to prop up the book she&#x2019;d just finished reading to him. Dressed in jeans and a well-washed blue uniform shirt, all she needed to do was pull on her boots and she would be out the door and on her way to work, which was where she was going just as soon as she finished her nightly ritual of putting Tyler to bed. &#x201c;Mrs. Menifee is here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sound of the TV in the living room confirmed it. Cindy Menifee, a fifty-something widow who lived alone in the duplex next door, had a key and let herself in as needed. The first thing she always did was turn on the TV. Mrs. Menifee worked days as a bookkeeper for a tire store. Like everyone else Sam knew, she lived from paycheck to paycheck and was glad, for the little Sam could pay her, to stay with Tyler at night while Sam worked, saying that since she was right next door anyway it was almost like getting paid to stay home.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Tyler&#x2019;s voice was even smaller. His skin was fair, like hers, but unlike her he had freckles scattered across the bridge of his nose. His eyes beseeched her. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t you stay home this once?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam&#x2019;s stomach tightened. She knew that feeling guilty because she had to go to work to earn money to support them was a waste of time, but Tyler actually was a little extra needy tonight. He&#x2019;d had a bad day at preschool: his friend Josh had invited two other boys from their class to a sleepover, but had left Tyler out. To make him feel better, she&#x2019;d rented a movie he&#x2019;d been dying to see, and he and she had spent the evening eating popcorn and watching it, which was why he was still awake. Almost she hesitated. Almost she gave into the impulse to say, just this once, and stay with him. But she had to work, or they didn&#x2019;t eat or have a roof over their heads or anything else. She had tried to arrange things so that she and Tyler spent as much time together as possible. During the mornings, while he was in preschool, she took classes, with the eventual goal of becoming an emergency medical technician. As an EMT, she would make enough to one day maybe be able to buy a small house, and pay for things like a bicycle and braces. At night, when he was sleeping, she went out and repossessed cars. She was tired and stressed out a lot, which she tried her best not to let Tyler see, but they were making it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Big Red&#x2019;s waiting out front. He&#x2019;d be sad if I didn&#x2019;t come out.&#x201d; Big Red was Tyler&#x2019;s name for the (big red) tow truck she drove. Sliding off the bed, putting the book down on the nightstand, Sam kept her tone light.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you use the monster spray?&#x201d; Tyler&#x2019;s lower lip quivered. Sam felt another of those mommy-guilt heart tugs. Tyler had been having nightmares lately, nightmares that the pediatrician said were perfectly normal and part of a developmental phase and yada yada. Still, they worried her terribly. She&#x2019;d come up with the idea of filling a plastic spray bottle with water and telling Tyler it was a potion to keep bad dreams away. He loved the idea of it, called it monster spray, had her spray it under his bed every night before he went to sleep&#x2014;and continued to have nightmares anyway.<br> <br>Sam couldn&#x2019;t help thinking that if he had an older, more experienced mother, if he lived in a house in the suburbs and had a dad who was actually a part of his life and all the good things he should have, he wouldn&#x2019;t have nightmares.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tyler, do you want me to sit in here with you while you go to sleep? I can sing to you,&#x201d; Mrs. Menifee said from the doorway. Mrs. Menifee knew the drill: Sam was supposed to be at A+ Collateral Recovery by 11:00 p.m. to receive her assignments for the night. It was twenty minutes until eleven now. She had to go.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Tyler said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Sam smiled at Mrs. Menifee with real gratitude as the older woman pulled the red rocking chair that Sam had carefully painted to match the lamp and the headboard up beside the bed and sank down in it. Mrs. Menifee&#x2019;s tightly curled hair might be a little too red and she might wear a little too much makeup and her blouses might be a little too tight and low cut over her ample bosom in hopes of attracting husband number three, but she was kindhearted and good to Tyler and absolutely reliable. In the year since Sam and Tyler had moved into the duplex next door to her, they&#x2019;d all three developed a firm friendship in which Sam did things like water her plants and feed her cat when she was away visiting her grown daughter in Chicago, and Mrs. Menifee watched Tyler.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you in the morning.&#x201d; Still keeping it light, Sam headed for the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; Mrs. Menifee said comfortably.<br> <br>Pausing, Sam took one last look at her son. He was perfectly fine, cozy in his own bed in his own room, with Mrs. Menifee rocking beside him.<br> <br>His eyes were wide open and tracking her. &#x201c;I love you, Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her heart gave another of those mommy-pangs. &#x201c;I love you, too, baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>As she left the duplex to go to work, Mrs. Menifee&#x2019;s slightly off-key voice singing &#x201c;Camptown Races&#x201d; followed her.<br> <br><br> <br>About fifteen seconds before the first bullet hit him, Daniel Panterro accepted the fact that he was probably going to die. Given the fact that he was bound hand and foot, stuffed into a car trunk, and just conscious enough that he knew something bad was going down, there wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot he could do about it. Except bitterly regret the circumstances that had gotten him into the mess in the first place.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really think we wouldn&#x2019;t find you, asshole?&#x201d; Army Veith was the name of the guy pointing the pistol at his head. Real average looking. Average height, average weight, not old, not young, nothing to make anyone remember him. No way for anyone to guess that he was a killer for hire. One of the best. Currently in the employ of the Zeta cartel. Veith had just arrived on the scene, which was how Danny knew his life could now be measured in seconds. Everything that had come before had been courtesy of his thugs. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the money?&#x201d;<br> <br>Danny&#x2019;s mouth was still dry from the gag that had just been ripped out of it so he could talk. He tried to swallow, but came up with so little saliva that it was hardly worth it. He had no idea what money Veith was talking about, but he sure as hell was not going to let Veith know it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sock drawer,&#x201d; Danny croaked. He might be done for, but he&#x2019;d be damned if he was going to cringe. He tried not to think of his mother, a sixty-six-year-old widow who doted on him, her youngest child and only son. His death would devastate her. It would leave his three sisters reeling. He would never play basketball or video games with his nephews again.<br> <br>Please God let&#x2014;<br> <br>Veith shot him. Just like that.<br> <br>In the thigh. At the last minute Veith had shifted his aim. The pfft of the discharge&#x2014;Veith&#x2019;s gun sported a silencer&#x2014;registered in Danny&#x2019;s brain at approximately the same instant the bullet tore through him.<br> <br>Danny screamed. It hurt like a motherfucker. His thigh felt like a flaming splinter had blasted through it. He could feel the instant engorging of his flesh, the hot upwelling of blood. Had the bullet hit an artery? Broken a bone? Sweat poured over him in a wave. He almost vomited. His body wanted to roll and kick and contort in protest, but between the way he was tied and the fact that he was a six-foot-two, 190-pound guy crammed into a car trunk, the opportunity for movement was limited. Cursing, he tried to block out the pain, tried to force his poor battered brain to work, to think of some way out of this.<br> <br>Unfortunately, his brain was coming up with zilch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Next one goes through your elbow.&#x201d; Veith&#x2019;s eyes were as cold and merciless as the black waters of the Mississippi River that ran behind the warehouse. The river where, unless Danny was mistaken, his corpse was shortly going to end up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna ask again: where&#x2019;s the money?&#x201d;<br> <br>Shit. Danny realized that he was panting like a dog. He could feel blood gushing from his leg, soaking his jeans, and knew that blood loss was going to be a problem if he lived longer than the next few minutes. Which, face it, meant it probably wasn&#x2019;t going to be a problem at all. A black wave of anger hit him: somebody had fucked up big time. But this wasn&#x2019;t the moment to get pissed about it. This was probably the moment to be making peace with his maker, but he&#x2019;d rather try to come up with some way to survive. Forget cringing. Now that he&#x2019;d gotten a real taste of what was getting ready to come his way, he would have begged if he&#x2019;d thought it would do any good. Despite his efforts to block the pain, it threatened to overwhelm his senses. Jesus, when he&#x2019;d signed on for this gig he had accepted the possibility that he might die&#x2014;it came with the territory&#x2014;but getting himself blasted to bits before they killed him was worse than anything he had foreseen.<br> <br>Damn Crittenden anyway. Where was he, where were they all, while this shit was going down? The key here was that he wasn&#x2019;t actually supposed to die.<br> <br>Veith&#x2019;s gun hand moved, almost imperceptibly. Danny&#x2019;s heart lurched. He thought of his mother having to identify his mutilated body, pushed the image out of his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Santos has it,&#x201d; he groaned. It was a lie, but if lying worked to buy him some time, he was ready, willing, and able to lie like a two-dollar whore.<br> <br>Veith didn&#x2019;t fire.<br> <br>&#x201c;Santos?&#x201d; Veith repeated. Except for one dim lightbulb swinging from a wire high overhead, the warehouse was dark. If you didn&#x2019;t count Danny, Veith, two other thugs, and the BMW Danny was crammed into the trunk of, it was also deserted. The better for torturing and killing you in, my dear. Given Danny&#x2019;s present position, reading Veith&#x2019;s expression was nearly impossible. But he could hear the sudden interest in his voice.<br> <br>Veith thought there might be a possibility that he was telling the truth. Danny automatically filed that information away to be passed on to Crittenden later before he remembered that he most likely was not going to be passing on anything.<br> <br>Because he was going to be dead.<br> <br>Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, he didn&#x2019;t want to die. He was thirty-two years old. Had a big, boisterous extended family. A hot girlfriend. A good (although dangerous, see present situation) job. Tickets to the NBA championship game in two weeks. Lots of things in the works.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have five seconds to tell me everything you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Veith was taking careful aim at his right elbow. The one that was uppermost. If a bullet tore through his elbow at that angle, the pain would make the blazing agony in his leg feel like a mosquito bite. To say nothing of the fact that it would shatter the joint and he would probably never regain the full use of his arm. Not that he was going to need it where it looked like he was going anyway, but still.<br> <br>Shit.<br> <br>&#x201c;One. Two. Three. F&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>It was the thought of more pain that pulled his foggy thought processes together enough to allow him to try to improvise.<br> <br>As a new wave of sweat enveloped him, he broke in on Veith. &#x201c;Like I said, Santos&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re coming. They know where we are.&#x201d; Thug number one&#x2014;Danny hadn&#x2019;t gotten a good enough look at either of them to be able to identify them&#x2014;came running, his feet thudding on what sounded like a concrete floor. From where? Danny didn&#x2019;t know, although he presumed a lookout was being kept.<br> <br>Theoretically, he was too valuable to the feds who&#x2019;d been holding him for them to just abandon him. Veith would expect a search-and-rescue team to be coming on strong.<br> <br>So did Danny, for entirely different reasons.<br> <br>Veith swore under his breath. To Danny&#x2019;s immense relief, he lowered the pistol.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll finish this later, Marco,&#x201d; Veith told him.<br> <br>Yeah, Marco, as in Rick Marco, because Veith had no idea who he really was. Which was the only reason Danny was still alive.<br> <br>Then Veith stepped back, and the trunk lid slammed down.<br> <br>A moment later, the car was peeling rubber out of there. Danny lay in the trunk, blind as a mole in the pitch dark, woozy with pain, fighting to find enough oxygen to keep him conscious in the superheated, carbon-monoxide-tainted air.<br> <br>He was still trying to process exactly what had happened. No, how it had happened: the assault on the safe house where as Marco he&#x2019;d been under twenty-four-hour guard, the lightning-fast slaughter of the U.S. Marshals assigned to protect him, his own kidnapping and brutal interrogation.<br> <br>They&#x2019;re coming. Danny held onto the promise implicit in that gasped warning like a drowning man to a lifeline. &#x201c;They&#x201d; had to refer to the feds. He was an undercover FBI agent, for God&#x2019;s sake. His fellow federal agents would not just leave him to die.<br> <br><br> <br>Two a.m. in gorgeous downtown East St. Louis, which was an oxymoron if she&#x2019;d ever heard one, Sam reflected glumly. A Friday night turned into the wee hours of a Saturday morning. She was still pretty enough that guys were always hitting on her. She should have been out dancing, partying, or at least seeing a movie and getting a pizza. Something.<br> <br>She sighed. Get real. If you weren&#x2019;t doing this, you&#x2019;d be working the third shift at Walmart. Or Waffle House.

Towards the end of his life, Mollo continued to write stories about the same well-loved characters (the Hideous Hog, the Rueful Rabbit, Oscar the Owl, and the rest), but they appeared in various magazines around the world, and if you weren&#39;t a subscriber, you didn&#39;t get to read them. This is the final MPP anthology of these lost Menagerie gems, collected for the first time in book form (following The Hog Takes to Precision, Diamonds are the Hog&#39;s Best Friend and Swings and Arrows). Victor Mollo is everyone&#39;s favorite bridge humorist, and a genuinely new book from him will be greeted as something to be treasured. Illustrations by bridge cartoonist Bill Buttle add to the fun.</p><p>The late Victor Mollo (London, UK) is one of the best-loved authors ever to write about bridge. He wrote many excellent how-to books on the game (including the classic Card Play Technique, with Nico Gardener) but it is as a humorist, and the author of Bridge in the Menagerie and its sequels, that he is best remembered.</p><h2>LILY AND THE OCTOPUS</h2><p>&#x2018;Intelligently written, finely observed and surprisingly moving, this is a book you&#x2019;ll find hard to put down&#x2019; GRAEME SIMSION , author of The Rosie Project Companions come in all shapes and sizes.

Educated at the College of Saint Rose and Cornell University, she became interested in weaving and fiber arts while living in South Westerlo, New York, where she raised four children and forty sheep. Elaine Greenstein began making children&#39;s books about 15 years ago and is the author and illustrator of the popular Ice Cream Cones for Sale. Currently, she is working on a book about Konrad Lorenz. Greenstein also had stints as a pastry chef and a sculptor. She lives with her husband, Jose, in Brooklyn, New York.PreSchool-K?One winter day, elderly Sarah notices a young boy at the bus stop without mittens, so she knits him a pair and leaves them on a tree where he'll find them. She continues to knit (anonymously) and leaves mittens for the children who need them. One day, a large basket of yarn is left on her doorstep, enabling her to continue her work.

Ana�s Nin said 'I think often of Nancy's most eloquent silences, Nancy talking with her fingers, her hair, her cheeks, a wonderful gift. Music again.' As the first wife Lawrence Durrell, author of The Alexandria Quartet, it is perhaps surprising that she is an unknown entity, a constant presence in the biographies of Durrell and others in the Bloomsbury set, yet always a shadowy figure, beautiful and enigmatic. </p><p>But who was the woman who was with Durrell during the most important years of his development as a writer? Joanna Hodgkin decides to retrace her mother's fascinating story: the escape from her toxic and mysterious family; the years in bohemian literary London and Paris in the 1930s; marriage to Durrell and their discovery of the 'Eden' of pre-war Corfu and her desperate struggle to survive in Palestine alone with a small child as the British Mandate collapsed. Amateurs in Eden is a fascinating biography of a literary marriage and of an unusual woman struggling to live an independent life.</p></p><p>Joanna Hodgkin has written several successful psychologial thrillers as Joanna Hines.A truly fascinating account of one of those many women, the wives and the girlfriends and the sisters of famous literary men, who have lived a twilight existence in the shadows of the historical canon. A particularly rich and honest account&#x2015;<b><i>Scotland on Sunday</i></b><br><br>This is not just a memoir of her mother. This is the history of a literary wife.

The still-raging French Revolution continues to claim lives, and the shadow of the guillotine draws ever nearer to the young Dauphin, son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. No one dares to attempt to liberate the little prince &#x2014; no one, that is, but the mysterious Sir Percy Blakeney, also known as the Scarlet Pimpernel. Sir Percy takes on one of Robespierre's agents, the scheming Citizen Chauvelin, in a suspenseful blend of action and political intrigue, recounted with captivating period detail. Unabridged republication of the classic 1913 edition.</p><p></p><h2>Paris: The Secret History</h2><p><p>If Adam Gopnik's <i>Paris to the Moon</i> described daily life in contemporary Paris, this book describes daily life in Paris throughout its history: a history of the city from the point of view of the Parisians themselves. Paris captures everyone's imaginations: It's a backdrop for Proust's fictional pederast, Robert Doisneau's photographic kiss, and Edith Piaf's serenaded soldier-lovers; a home as much to romance and love poems as to prostitution and opium dens. The many pieces of the city coexist, each one as real as the next. What's more, the conflicted identity of the city is visible everywhere&#x2015;between cobblestones, in bars, on the <i>m�tro</i>.</p><p>In this lively and lucid volume, Andrew Hussey brings to life the urchins and artists who've left their marks on the city, filling in the gaps of a history that affected the disenfranchised as much as the nobility. <i>Paris: The Secret History</i> ranges across centuries, movements, and cultural and political beliefs, from Napoleon's overcrowded cemeteries to Balzac's nocturnal flight from his debts. For Hussey, Paris is a city whose long and conflicted history continues to thrive and change. The book's is a picaresque journey through royal palaces, brothels, and sidewalk caf�s, uncovering the rich, exotic, and often lurid history of the world's most beloved city.</p></p><p><p><b>Andrew Hussey</b> is a cultural historian and biographer. His previous book, a critically acclaimed biography of Guy Debord, was published in 2001. He is Lecturer in French studies at the University of Aberystwyth and divides his time between Ireland, Wales and Paris.</p>The 16th-century French wars of religion were less about Christian theology than about who ruled France; centuries later the French authorities, aided by , a significant number of ordinary citizens "willingly and enthusiastically" sent tens of thousands of Parisian Jews to their deaths during WWII. In his sprawling, eclectic, self-indulgent and entertaining unofficial antihistory of Paris, Hussey (<i>The Game of War: The Life and Death of Guy Debord</i>), head of French and comparative literature at the University of London in Paris, tells the story of Paris from the perspective of the city's marginal and subversive elements&#x2014;insurrectionists, criminals, immigrants and sexual outsiders. Highlights include descriptions of the Pont-Neuf during the reigns of Henri IV and Louis XIII as a cultural epicenter, a hangout for con artists and prostitutes, and a cauldron of antigovernment, antiroyal and antireligious activity. Hussey also tells of the "sacred geometry" of Notre-Dame as vivified by Victor Hugo. Also noteworthy in this overstuffed, unrestrained effort are Hussey's critique of former French president Mitterrand as "a master of double-dealing and double-talk whose only real loyalty was to himself and his position in power," and Hussey's take on the 2005 riots instigated by violent black and Arab suburban youths.

Similar to chess, it leaves nothing to chance, requiring great strategy and carefully plotted campaigns to achieve an impregnable position, block enemies from lines of communication and win a series of battles. To penetrate this complicated, challenging game requires a great guide&#x2014; and this is it.

Two Millennium journalists about to expose the truth about the sex trade in Sweden are brutally murdered, and Salander&#39;s prints are on the weapon. Her history of unpredictable and vengeful behaviour makes her an official danger to society - but no-one can find her anywhere. Meanwhile, Mikael Blomkvist, editor-in-chief of Millennium, will not believe what he hears on the news. Knowing Salander to be fierce when fearful, he is desperate to get to her before she is cornered and alone. As he fits the pieces of the puzzle together, he comes up against some hardened criminals, including the chainsaw-wielding &#39;blond giant&#39; - a fearsomely huge thug who can feel no pain. Digging deeper, Blomkvist also unearths some heart-wrenching facts about Salander&#39;s past life. Committed to psychiatric care aged 12, declared legally incompetent at 18, this is a messed-up young woman who is the product of an unjust and corrupt system. Yet Lisbeth is more avenging angel than</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, July 2009:</strong> The girl with the dragon tattoo is back. Stieg Larsson's seething heroine, Lisbeth Salander, once again finds herself paired with journalist Mikael Blomkvist on the trail of a sinister criminal enterprise. Only this time, Lisbeth must return to the darkness of her own past (more specifically, an event coldly known as "All the Evil") if she is to stay one step ahead--and alive. <i>The Girl Who Played with Fire</i> is a break-out-in-a-cold-sweat thriller that crackles with stunning twists and dismisses any talk of a sophomore slump. Fans of Larsson's prior work will find even more to love here, and readers who do not find their hearts racing within the first five pages may want to confirm they still have a pulse. Expect healthy doses of murder, betrayal, and deceit, as well as enough espresso drinks to fuel downtown Seattle for months. --<i>Dave Callanan</i>Stieg Larsson was the editor-in-chief of the anti-racist magazine Expo. He was a leading expert on right-wing extremist organisations. He died in 2004, soon after delivering the text of the novels that make up the Millennium Trilogy.</p><h2>Battles for Scandinavia (World War II #28)</h2><p>Recounts the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, the betrayal of Norway, and the occupation of Denmark</p><p></p><h2>The Orphanmaster: A Novel of Early Manhattan</h2><p><b>A love story wrapped around a murder mystery, set in seventeenth-century Manhattan</b><p></p><p>In 1663 in the hardscrabble colony of New Amsterdam&#x2014;today&#x2019;s lower Manhattan&#x2014;orphan children are going missing and residents suspect a serial killer.

It was trying to reach the light from the amber street lamp that shone through the gap in the curtains. Each time its wings batted against its prison, the Shaded Broad-bar Scotopteryx chenopodiata shed more of the powder that kept it in flight, leaving arrow-imprints on the glass.<br><br>"Concentrate hard on the moth, Madeline."<br><br>In the early evening drizzle, the Edwardian terraced house at 24 Cranmere Road was like a thousand others in the surrounding South London streets, its quiddity to be a part of the city's chaotic whole. There were shiny grey slates, dead chimney pots and shabby bay windows. The rain sketched silver signatures across the rooftops, leaving inky pools on empty pavements. At this time of the year it was an indoor world.<br><br>Behind dense green curtains, five women sat in what had once been the front parlour, narrowing their thoughts in the overheated air. The house was owned by Kate Summerton, a prematurely grey housewife who had reached the age at which so many suburban women faded from the view of men. As if to aid this new invisibility, she tied back her hair and wore TV-screen glasses with catalogue slacks and a shapeless faun cardigan.<br><br>Her guests were all neighbours except Madeline Gilby, who worked in the Costcutter supermarket on the Old Kent Road and was disturbingly beautiful, even when she arrived still wearing her blue cashier's smock. Kate had known her for almost three years, and it had taken that long to convince her that she possessed a rare gift beyond that of her grace.<br><br>The small brown moth batted feebly once more, then sank to the tablecloth. It was losing strength. Madeline furrowed her brow and pressed pale hands to her temples, shutting her eyes tight.<br><br>"He's tiring. Keep concentrating."<br><br>The Broad-bar made one final attempt to escape through the top of the glass, and fell back. One wing ticked rapidly and then became still.<br><br>"That,"said Jessica, adjusting her great glasses, "shows the true intensity of the directed mind. The energy you generated is not measurable by any electronic means, and yet it's enough to interfere with the nervous system of this poor little creature. Of course, the test is hardly very scientific, but it suffices to demonstrate the power you hold within you."<br><br>Madeline was astonished. She gasped and smiled at the others.<br><br>"You have the gift, dear, as all women do in different degrees," said Kate. "In time, and with our help, you'll be able to identify the auras of others, seeing deep inside their hearts. You'll instinctively know if they mean you good or harm, and will never need to fear a man again. From now on, you and your son will be safe."<br><br>Kate was clear and confident, conscious of her middle-class enunciation. As a professional, she was used to being heard and obeyed. She turned to the others. "You see how easy it is to harness your inner self? It is important to understand that, in a manner of speaking, all women have two hearts. The first is the muscle that pumps our blood, and the second is a psychic heart that, if properly developed, opens us to secret knowledge. You can all harness that heart-power, just as Madeline is doing. Males don't possess this second spiritual heart; they have only flesh and bone. They feel pain and pleasure, but there is no extra dimension to their feelings, whereas we are able to find deeper shading in our emotional spirituality. This is the defence we develop against those who hurt us and our children, because most men do eventually, even if they never intend to. They are fundamentally different creatures, and fail to understand the damage they cause. With training, we can open a pathway illuminated by the pure light of truth, and see into the hearts of men. This is the breakthrough that Madeline has achieved today, in this room.?"<br><br>Madeline was unable to stop herself from crying. As a child she had been lonely and imaginative, used to spending long afternoons with books and make-believe friends until boys discovered her nascent beauty. Then the nightmare had begun. Now, there was a chance that it might really be over. For the first time since she had met Kate, she truly believed that her power existed.<br><br>"That's it, let it all out,"said her mentor, placing a plump arm around her as the others murmured their approval. "It always comes as a shock the first time. You'll get used to it."<br><br>Madeline needed air. She left the suffocating parlour and passed quickly through the herb-filled kitchen into the garden, where she found her son kicking sulkily at the flower beds that held etiolated rosebushes, each with a single despondent pink bloom.<br><br>"It's cold out here, Ryan. You should stay indoors."<br><br>"Her husband smokes."<br><br>"Even so." Madeline rubbed her bare arms briskly, looking about. The Anderson shelters and chicken sheds of postwar London had been replaced with rows of flat-pack conservatories. New attics and kitchens thrust out along the terrace, the residents pushing their property boundaries as if halfheartedly trying to break free of the past. "I'm ready to go now. Come and get your jacket. We'll go home."<br><br>As the neighbours gathered in the hall with their coats, Mrs Summerton removed the tumbler from the parlour table, crushing the moth between her thumb and forefinger before it had a chance to revive, flicking it into the waste bin. She had started her refuge over twenty years ago, when alcohol abuse had been the main problem. Now it was drugs, not that men needed to take stimulants before battering their partners. Madeline had come to her with a black eye and a sprained arm, but had still been anxious to get home on that first evening in order to cook her husband's dinner. Seeing the gratitude in her protegee's eyes made Kate sure she was doing the right thing, even if it meant performing a little parlour trick with a moth. Madeline was a good mother, kind and decent, but badly damaged by her relationships with men. If she could not be taught to seek independence and protect herself by traditional means, it was valid to introduce more unconventional methods. Mrs Summerton said her good-byes and closed the front door, then checked the time and went to change, remembering that someone new was coming to the shelter tonight. She only had room for eight women, and the new girl would make nine, but how would she ever forgive herself if she sent her home without help? Besides, the new girl came from a wealthy family; her fee could finance the refuge for months.<br><br>Mr Summerton stayed in the kitchen reading his paper. He had coped with the house being turned into a women's shelter, had even enjoyed it for a while, but now it was best to stay out of the way. His wife was honest down to her bones, he had always known that. She had made a few missteps in her overeagerness to help, that was all, but now she was exploring strange new territory, enjoining the women to discover their innate psychic powers and leave their husbands&#x2014;encouraging suspicion and hatred of all men, of which he disapproved.<br><br>Still, she was a force of nature when she made up her mind, and he knew better than to raise his voice in protest. There had always been too many women in the house, Kate's friends, their daughters&#x2014;even the cat was a female. His mother had once warned him that all women go mad eventually, and he was starting to believe it. Overlooked and outnumbered, he sipped his tea and turned to the sports pages.<br><br>Madeline walked home in the rain, clutching Ryan's hand too tightly. "Why are we walking?" asked the boy. "It's bloody freezing."<br><br>"Don't swear," his mother admonished. "I haven't got enough bus fare. It's not very far, and the exercise is good for you.?"<br><br>"That's because you gave all your money to her."<br><br>It was true that Mrs Summerton charged for her services, but you couldn't expect her to do it for nothing. Kate had made sense of her life. During her lonely childhood years, Madeline had been sure that some secret part of her was waiting to be discovered. But instead of gaining self-knowledge she became beautiful, and the curse began. Boys from her school hung around her house, laying their traps and baiting their lies with promises. She had even seen that terrible crafty gleam in her own father's eyes. She trusted easily, and was hurt each time. Beauty made her shy, and shyness made her controllable.<br><br>Now, at thirty years of age, she was finally discovering a way of standing up to the men who had always manipulated her. She owed Kate Summerton everything.<br><br>"Is she a lady doctor?"asked Ryan.<br><br>"Not exactly. What makes you think that?<br><br>"You went to see her when you hurt yourself."<br><br>Madeline had told her son that she'd fallen in the garden, and he seemed to believe her. "She was very kind to me," she said.<br><br>"You were ages in there," Ryan probed, watching her face in puzzlement. "I was stuck in the smoky kitchen with her horrible daughters and her boring husband. What were you doing?"<br><br>"Mrs Summerton was helping to teach me something."She was unsure about broaching the subject with her son. He was at the age where he seemed simultaneously too clever and too childish.<br>"You mean like school lessons?" Ryan persisted. 'What was she teaching you?'<br><br>Madeline remained quiet until they had turned the high corner wall of Greenwich Park. Winter mist was settling across the plane trees in a veil of dewdrops. "She was showing me how to deal with your father,?" she said at last.<br><br><i><br>Chapter Two<br><br>The Shaping of Men</i><br>Johann Bellocq stretched up on the staircase to the sea, and pulled another of the ripe oran...</p><h2>The Beer and Whisky League: The Illustrated History of the American Association--Baseball&#39;s Renegade Major League</h2><p>Although the American Association lasted only a decade, from 1882 to 1891, it rewrote the playbook on baseball, establishing many of the conventions we still honor.

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1908. Excerpt: ... Rejoicing in the Lord The children of God are called to be representatives of Christ, showing forth the goodness and mercy of the Lord. As Jesus has revealed to us the true character of the Father, so we are to reveal Christ to a world that does not know his tender, pitying love. &#34;As thou hast sent me into the world,&#34; said Jesus, &#34;even so have I also sent them into the world.&#34; &#34;I in them, and thou in me, . . . that the world may know that thou hast sent me.&#34;1 The apostle Paul says to the disciples of Jesus, &#34; Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ,&#34; &#34;known and read of all men.&#34;2 In every one of his children, Jesus sends a letter to the world. If you are Christ&#39;s follower, he sends in you a letter to the family, the village, the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted with him. Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love of God through his works. But if you are a true representative of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand something of his goodness, and be won to love and serve him. Christians are set as light bearers on the way to heaven. They are to reflect to the world the light shining upon them from Christ . Their life and character should be such that through them others will get a right conception of Christ and of his service. 1 John 17: 18. 23. :1 Cor. R: 8. 2. If we do represent Christ, we shall make his service appear attractive, as it really is. Christians who gather up gloom and sadness to their souls,, and murmur and complain, are giving to others a false representation of God and the Christian life. They give the impression that God is not pleased to have his children happy, and in t...</p><p>White was a founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p><h2>Symphony No. 3 in F Major, Op. 90 (Dover Miniature Music Scores)</h2><p><p>For a composer who devoted nearly two decades to the completion of his first symphony and three years to his second, Johannes Brahms's mature grasp of symphonic form and the orchestral art led to the comparatively rapid completion of his Symphony No. 3, Op. 90. Driven by a conception of this major new work during a trip to the Rhine, Brahms immediately arranged for a summer rental in Wiesbaden, where he wrote the whole work, virtually without pause, over four months of 1883. He was then 50 years old, and at the height both of his powers as a composer and of his public acceptance as a major artist of his time.<br>Brahms' Symphony No. 3 is presented here in full score, with bar-numbered movements and ample margins at the bottom of each score page for notes and analysis. Ideal for study in the classroom, at home, or in the concert hall, this affordable, high-quality, conveniently sized volume will be the edition of choice for music students and music lovers alike.<br></p><p></p></p><p>German-born composer Johannes Brahms (1833&#x2013;97),&nbsp;an important figure of the Romantic era,&nbsp;spent most of his career at the forefront of the Viennese musical scene.

But he was an exceptionally diverse author who wrote in numerous genres. Even at the beginning of his writing career, Frank Herbert wrote whatever inspired him, irrespective of genre, market, or audience tastes.After the success of his first novel The Dragon in the Sea (1955), Herbert wrote numerous novels and short stories that failed to find a market. He persevered until finally, seven years later, he wrote the most unpublishable novel of all, Dune&#x2014;which, once it finally found a home with an obscure publisher, finally made Frank Herbert a household name synonymous with science fiction.This volume collects four of those complete, never-before-published novels written before Dune: High-Opp, a dystopian science fiction novel; Angels&#x2019; Fall, a jungle survival adventure; A Game of Authors, a Cold War thriller; and A Thorn in the Bush, a mainstream novel based on some of Herbert&#x2019;s experiences in Mexico.</p><p>Frank Herbert (1920-1986) created the most beloved novel in the annals of science fiction, "Dune". He was a man of many facets, of countless passageways that ran through an intricate mind. His magnum opus is a reflection of this, a classic work that stands as one of the most complex, multi-layered novels ever written in any genre. Today the novel is more popular than ever, with new readers continually discovering it and telling their friends to pick up a copy. It has been translated into dozens of languages and has sold almost 20 million copies. <p>As a child growing up in Washington State, Frank Herbert was curious about everything. He carried around a Boy Scout pack with books in it, and he was always reading. He loved Rover Boys adventures, as well as the stories of H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, and the science fiction of Edgar Rice Burroughs. On his eighth birthday, Frank stood on top of the breakfast table at his family home and announced, "I wanna be a author." His maternal grandfather, John McCarthy, said of the boy, "It's frightening. A kid that small shouldn't be so smart." Young Frank was not unlike Alia in "Dune", a person having adult comprehension in a child's body. In grade school he was the acknowledged authority on everything. If his classmates wanted to know the answer to something, such as about sexual functions or how to make a carbide cannon, they would invariably say, "Let's ask Herbert. He'll know."</p> <p>His curiosity and independent spirit got him into trouble more than once when he was growing up, and caused him difficulties as an adult as well. He did not graduate from college because he refused to take the required courses for a major; he only wanted to study what interested him. For years he had a hard time making a living, bouncing from job to job and from town to town. He was so independent that he refused to write for a particular market; he wrote what he felt like writing. It took him six years of research and writing to complete "Dune", and after all that struggle and sacrifice, 23 publishers rejected it in book form before it was finally accepted. He received an advance of only $7,500.</p> <p>His loving wife of 37 years, Beverly, was the breadwinner much of the time, as an underpaid advertising writer for department stores. Having been divorced from his first wife, Flora Parkinson, Frank Herbert met Beverly Stuart at a University of Washington creative writing class in 1946. At the time, they were the only students in the class who had sold their work for publication. Frank had sold two pulp adventure stories to magazines, one to "Esquire" and the other to "Doc Savage". Beverly had sold a story to "Modern Romance" magazine. These genres reflected the interests of the two young lovers; he the adventurer, the strong, machismo man, and she the romantic, exceedingly feminine and soft-spoken.</p> <p>Their marriage would produce two sons, Brian, born in 1947, and Bruce, born in 1951. Frank also had a daughter, Penny, born in 1942 from his first marriage. For more than two decades Frank and Beverly would struggle to make ends meet, and there were many hard times. In order to pay the bills and to allow her husband the freedom he needed in order to create, Beverly gave up her own creative writing career in order to support his. They were in fact a writing team, as he discussed every aspect of his stories with her, and she edited his work. Theirs was a remarkable, though tragic, love story-which Brian would poignantly describe one day in "Dreamer of Dune" (Tor Books; April 2003). After Beverly passed away, Frank married Theresa Shackelford. </p> <p>In all, Frank Herbert wrote nearly 30 popular books and collections of short stories, including six novels set in the "Dune" universe: "Dune", "Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune", "Heretics of Dune", and "Chapterhouse: Dune". All were international bestsellers, as were a number of his other science fiction novels, which include "The White Plague" and "The Dosadi Experiment". His major novels included "The Dragon in the Sea", "Soul Catcher" (his only non-science fiction novel), "Destination: " "Void", "The Santaroga Barrier", "The Green Brain", "Hellstorm's Hive", "Whipping Star", "The Eyes of" "Heisenberg", "The Godmakers", "Direct Descent", and "The Heaven Makers". He also collaborated with Bill Ransom to write "The Jesus Incident", "The Lazarus Effect", and "The Ascension Factor". Frank Herbert's last published novel, "Man of Two Worlds", was a collaboration with his son, Brian.</p></p><h2>A Gift from the Lonely Doll</h2><p>A Gift from the Lonely Doll was first published in 1966 and is one of the most frequently requested and fondly remembered books in the Lonely Doll series by the author/photographer Dare Wright.

Leading historians, economists and geographers &#x2013; from Ireland, Britain and the United States &#x2013; have assembled the most up-to-date research from a wide spectrum of disciplines including medicine, folklore and literature, to give the fullest account yet of the background and consequences of the Famine. Contributors include Dr Kevin Whelan, Professor Mary Daly, Professor James Donnelly and Professor Cormac � Gr�da. <i>The Great Irish Famine</i>&nbsp;was the first major series of essays on the Famine published in Ireland for almost fifty years.</p><p>Raised and educated in Massachusetts, SEAN CONNOLLY now lives in Wiltshire, England, where he works as a writer and editor, specializing in children&#x2019;s books. His best-known titles are The Book of Totally Irresponsible Science (2008, now in its eleventh printing), The Book of Potentially Catastrophic Science, and Perfectly Perilous Math (2012).<br>There is no single event in Irish history that produces more emotion, speculation and controversy than the Great Famine of 1845-1851. Analyses of the famine tend toward extremes: accusations of genocide on the part of the British were countered by revisionism of the worst kind in the mid-20th century. Originally a series of lectures broadcast on Irish National Radio, this book attempts to sort out the facts from the myths and accusations by commissioning new studies from 16 experts. Contributors include medical doctors, sociologists, historians, folklorists, economists, and other historical specialists. For a study of this kind, the collective results make for a surprisingly gripping read. Readers will uncover: why there was such a singular dependency on the potato; a breakdown of the diseases that ensued; and why the social, economic and religious doctrines that prevailed at the time led to vastly inappropriate and often downright cruel relief policies. The research is meticulous and but the writing is uniformly accessible. By using contemporary journals, letters, reports and parish records, the contributors also manage to create a vivid, often harrowing, picture of the mass starvation, disease, deliberate large-scale evictions and landlords' cynical encouragement of emigration. But they also render a heartbreaking account of a human tragedy whose passion bleeds through what might initially be dismissed as just another academic study. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jelly Roll Quilts &amp; More</h2><p>Cleverly combine basic units to create one-of-a-kind designs that may look complex but are easy to assemble.

Kevin&#39;s wife has joined a homegrown cult, and his son is a disciple of the prophet Holy Wayne. Only Jill, Kevin&#39;s daughter, remains, and she&#39;s no longer the sweet student she once was. Written with a rare ability to illuminate our everyday struggles, `The Leftovers&#39; is a startling novel about love, connection and loss.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2011:</strong> Author Tom Perrotta is a master at exposing the quiet desperation behind America&#x2019;s suburban sheen. In <i>The Leftovers</i> he explores what would happen if The Rapture actually took place and millions of people just disappeared from the earth. How would normal people respond? Perrotta&#x2019;s characters show a variety of coping techniques, including indifference, avoidance, depression, freaking out, and the joining of cults. Despite the exceptional circumstances, it&#x2019;s really not unlike how people respond to more minor incidents in their lives (excepting cults). The result is a novel that&#x2019;s a slow burn yet strangely compelling, one that leaves the reader pondering the story long after it&#x2019;s over. In vivid and occasionally satiric prose, he takes a bizarre and abnormal event--the Rapture--and imagines how normal people would deal with being left behind. <i>--Chris Schluep</i></p>Tom Perrotta is the author of several works of fiction, including `Little Children&#39;, `Joe College&#39; and `Election&#39;.

In this provocative new book, historian Donald T. Critchlow sheds new light on Schlafly's life and on the unappreciated role her grassroots activism played in transforming America's political landscape.</p><br><p> Based on exclusive and unrestricted access to Schlafly's papers as well as sixty other archival collections, the book reveals for the first time the inside story of this Missouri-born mother of six who became one of the most controversial forces in modern political history. It takes us from Schlafly's political beginnings in the Republican Right after the World War II through her years as an anticommunist crusader to her more recent efforts to thwart same-sex marriage and stem the flow of illegal immigrants.</p><br><p> Schlafly's political career took off after her book <i>A Choice Not an Echo</i> helped secure Barry Goldwater's nomination. With sales of more than 3 million copies, the book established her as a national voice within the conservative movement. But it was Schlafly's bid to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment that gained her a grassroots following. Her anti-ERA crusade attracted hundreds of thousands of women into the conservative fold and earned her a name as feminism's most ardent opponent. In the 1970s, Schlafly founded the Eagle Forum, a Washington-based conservative policy organization that today claims a membership of 50,000 women.</p><br><p> Filled with fresh insights into these and other initiatives, <i>Phyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism</i> provides a telling profile of one of the most influential activists in recent history. Sure to invite spirited debate, it casts new light on a major shift in American politics, the emergence of the Republican Right.</p></p><p><p>"This book makes a number of important contributions to existing work on the rise of the Right, twentieth-century American politics, and the place of moral issues in the modern American conservative movement."--<b>Paula Baker, author of <i>The Moral Frameworks of Public Life: Gender, Politics, and the State in Rural New York, 1870-1930</i>.</b></p><p>"Richly researched and elegantly written, this gem of a book makes important contributions to the growing literature on the origins and surprising successes of modern conservatism. Underscoring the important role women have played on the Right, this political biography illuminates the relationship between civil society activism and intellectual direction, the importance of anticommunist legacies, and the crucial role played by the heady combination of religion and values in reshaping the polity."--<b>Ira Katznelson, Columbia University, author of <i>When Affirmative Action Was White</i></b></p><p>"In this timely and wonderfully researched book, Critchlow has provided us an invaluable guide to the grassroots politics basic to conservatives' rocky ascendancy over the last half century. The focus on Schlafly and the role of women conservatives make it essential reading for those interested in women's political activism and the making of Republican Right."--<b>Jane Sherron De Hart, University of California at Santa Barbara</b></p><p>"Anyone seeking to understand the historical roots of our current culture wars should read this illuminating book. Donald T. Critchlow has written a first-rate biography of a talented political activist---and made an impressive contribution to the historiography of American conservatism."--<b>George Nash, author of <i>The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945</i></b></p><p>"Conservatives will cheer and liberals weep at this careful, thoughtful, and sympathetic portrait of Phyllis Schlafly. Donald Critchlow's uses his compelling biography to tell an even larger story--the triumph of the American Right in the last third of the twentieth century."--<b>James A Morone, author of <i>Hellfire Nation: The Politics of Sin in American History</i> and <i>The Democratic Wish</i></b></p><p>"Phyllis Schlafly is the most consequential woman in American politics since Susan B. Anthony, and as such a full-scale biography is long overdue. Donald Critchlow delivers a thoroughly fair and dispassionate account of this chief scourge of feminism, who ironically proved just how powerful a woman can be in modern America."--<b>Steven F. Hayward, author of <i>The Age of Reagan: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order, 1964-1980</i></b></p><b>Donald T.

Beginning with the assertion that development assistance agencies are inherently structured to provide help that is ultimately unhelpful by overriding or undercutting the capacity of people to help themselves, David Ellerman argues that the best strategy for development is a drastic reduction in development assistance. The locus of initiative can then shift from the would-be helpers to the doers (recipients) of development. Ellerman presents various methods for shifting initiative that are indirect, enabling and autonomy-respecting. Eight representative figures in the fields of education, community organization, economic development, psychotherapy and management theory including: Albert Hirschman, Paulo Freire, John Dewey, and S�ren Kierkegaard demonstrate how the major themes of assisting autonomy among people are essentially the same.</p><p>David Ellerman is currently a Visiting Scholar in the Economics Department at the University of California at Riverside.</p></p><p>David P. Ellerman is currently a Visiting Scholar at the University of California at Riverside.&#34;A towering achievement. It outdoes Sen and Hirschman in its reach across economics, management theory, psychology, sociology, mathematics and philosophy. The result is a coherent alternative &#34;way of seeing&#34; the relationship between aid organizations based in rich countries and aid recipients based in poorer ones, and some practical suggestions on how to re-engage the aid agencies more as &#34;helpers&#34; than as &#34;doers&#34;. Along the way it fairly sizzles with insider insights into the workings of the World Bank.&#34; - Robert Hunter Wade, Development Studies Institute, London School of Economics &#34;Ellerman provides a compelling humanist understanding of how economic development aid can succeed, if only people and nations are enabled to help themselves.&#34; - William Greider, author of The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy&#34;</p><h2>The Body in the Belfry</h2><p>Ex-Manhattanite Faith Fairchild copes not only with the culture shock of the Massachusetts village in which she, her minister husband, and their baby have settled, but with the shock of finding a woman&#39;s body in the church&#39;s belfry</p><p>Katherine Hall Page is the author of twenty previous Faith Fairchild mysteries, the first of which received the Agatha Award for best first mystery. The Body in the Snowdrift was honored with the Agatha Award for best novel of 2006. Page also won an Agatha for her short story The Would-Be Widower. She has also been a nominee for the Edgar Award and the Mary Higgins Clark Award. She lives in Massachusetts with her husband.Page's first novel lacks professional polish and a likable heroine, flaws not compensated for by vivid evocations of a New England autumn in Aleford, Mass. This is home to Faith Fairchild, a native New Yorker, now the wife of the town minister, Tom, and mother of their baby Benjamin. Although she loves her husband and child, Faith belittles the stodgy townspeople, except for a few friends. Eager to help good neighbors Patricia and Robert Moore, the minister's wife throws herself into investigating the murder of their niece, Cindy Shepherd, whose body Faith discovers in the church belfry. Cindy had been an embarrassment to the Moores, her guardians after the death of her parents; a promiscuous young woman, she had upset virtually everyone, even her pathetic fiance, Dave Svenson. When the police arrest Dave, the logical suspect, Faith goes on sleuthing while Tom tries to help the youth and his family. The self-appointed detective pries into the affairs of numerous suspects, risking her life as well as the lives of Benjamin and another child. Perhaps Faith's continued adventures will find her less snobbish and almost as cute as she thinks she is. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Early American Gardens: &#34;For Meate or Medicine&#34;</h2><p><i>Early American Gardens</i>, published in 1970, was the first of three authoritative volumes of garden history by Ann Leighton. The 464-page masterwork of garden history was reissued in this paperback edition by University of Massachusetts Press in 1986.

The well-illustrated, thorough, and scholarly volume is a book for history buffs as well as avid and inquisitive gardeners.<br><br>Companion volumes by Ann Leighton<br><br><i>American Gardens in the Eighteenth Century "For Use or for Delight"<br>American Gardens of the Nineteenth Century "For Comfort and Affluence"</i></p><p>Ann Leighton was the professional name of Isadore Smith (1902-1985), the renowned garden historian, scholar, author, designer and landscape architect who, with Catherine C. &#34;Kitty&#34; Weeks, designed the colonial-themed gardens at the Weeks Brick House in Greenland, New Hampshire in 1977. Among many commissions, Smith designed the garden at the 1677 Whipple House in Ipswich, Massachusetts, which is owned by the Ipswich Historical Society. Smith neatly summed up the staying power of her subject matter in a brief book-jacket teaser: &#34;While buildings may decay and crumble, the plants of every age are still with us and need only to be collected and replanted to speak for the time and its people.&#34;"The gardens of the 17th century and the stalwart settlers who planted them are vividly recreated as one delves into the carefully researched pages of this scholarly volume. . . . To be savored in small servings, pondered and reread, this is a book for history buffs as well as inquisitive gardeners, and is one reference work not likely to gather dust on the shelf."&#x2015;<i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>"The sense of continuity is a haunting quality of Ann Leighton's delightful book of the early gardens in seventeenth-century New England. Before our eyes, she not only makes the gardens grow again 'for meate or medicine' but brings to vivid life the gardeners as well. . . .

Freeling is married, has four sons and one daughter and currently resides in France.What a heady pleasure: a "novel of suspense and mystery" that is stylishly written, urbane and civilized, that wears its wide learning gracefully and features popular French detective Henri Castang, who can without pomp and ceremony toss off quotations from Virginia Woolf and Auden, among others. An aristocratic lady has been murdered. Member of a reactionary family that still looks back upon the glory that was Napoleon, she loathed the heathen Algerians and was insanely convinced of a diabolical plot against La Patrie by villainous Communists, Jews and Freemasons. Newly posted to the provinces (to his dismay), Castang and his partner, the frisky, foul-mouthed Amazon, Veronique, are assigned to the case. Then the victim's husband, a rich wine merchant, is also murdered, and there is yet another suspicious death. Learning the identity of the miscreant is only one of the delights of the novel as novelof character and dialogue, of scenes freshly observed and deftly expressed in elegant language. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Defiant Gardens: Making Gardens in Wartime</h2><p>Why is it that in the midst of a war, one can still find gardens? In the most brutal environments, both stateside and on the battlefield, they continue to flourish. Wartime gardens are dramatic examples of what Kenneth I. Helphand calls defiant gardens&#x201d; gardens created in extreme social, political, economic, or cultural conditions. Illustrated with archival photos, this remarkable book examines gardens of war in the 20th century, including gardens built behind the trenches in World War I, in the Warsaw and other ghettos during World War II, and in Japanese-American internment camps, as well as gardens created by soldiers at their bases and encampments during wars in the Persian Gulf, Vietnam, and Korea. Proving that gardens are far more than peaceful respites from the outside world, <i>Defiant Gardens</i> is a thought-provoking analysis of why people create natural spaces.</p><p>Kenneth I Helphand is a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Oregon. He is the author of several previous books, and the former editor of Landscape Journal. A fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects, he is also an honorary member of the Israel Association of Landscape Architects.*Starred Review* Gardens that ignored the rules of nature and gardeners who challenged the laws of man are vitally united in Helphand's seminal and revelatory study of life during some of the most lethal conflicts of the twentieth century. From the torturous 475-mile trench line that formed the western front in World War I to the alien landscapes of the Japanese American internment camps in the U.S. during World War II, the sites of unfathomable human brutality also gave rise to acts of uplifting horticultural resistance. Whether they were subsistence vegetable beds improbably tilled beneath barbed wire fences in Nazi-created ghettos or symbolic topiaries artistically carved from brittle desert sagebrush, each audacious example bears solemn testimony to the assertive efforts of determined soldiers, POWs, Holocaust victims, and others to vanquish war's horrors through the spiritually ennobling act of gardening. Helphand's extensively researched history of gardens in wartime illuminates the grotesque juxtaposition of willful devastation and the astonishing tenacity required to create life in the face of death.<p> <i>Carol Haggas</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Her novels include Orphan Train and Bird in Hand. She lives in an old house in Montclair, New Jersey, with her husband, and three boys.</p> <p><strong>Christina Baker Kline: </strong>Your characters seem to have broken the "rule" that men and women can't be friends. Do you think this is possible only in novels?</p> <p><strong>Joshilyn Jackson:</strong> You might be asking the wrong person. When I was nineteen, I met a gangly, dark-haired, geeky guy with big feet and a weird sense of humor. He quickly became my dearest friend. In those days, I would have said, &#x201c;Of course they can!&#x201d;</p> <p>Seven years later? He&#x2019;d grown into the big feet and become one helluva man. Reader, I married him. Twenty years and two kids later, I still like him best. </p> <p>The man/woman thing is powerful, and it can be so sneaky. Attraction can grow between the most unlikely pairings, given time and shared experiences and discovered connections. It doesn&#x2019;t always happen, but it&#x2019;s a risk. Better not to mess around with it if you&#x2019;re sure you do not want it. You can&#x2019;t get sex back to sleep once it&#x2019;s good and woken. </p> <p><i>Someone Else&#x2019;s Love Story</i> has two sets of man/woman best friends, and I didn&#x2019;t want attraction to intrude on the dynamics. I tried several ways to remove it entirely from both equations, but it didn&#x2019;t work until I attacked sex where it is most powerful&#x2014;in its mystery. I took away wondering and speculation; both pairs of friends have already had sex with each other before the novel begins.</p> <p>Men and women can&#x2019;t get around sex, true, but I thought perhaps these two friend-pairs had elected to move through it. Through it, and into something else.</p> <p><strong>CBK: </strong>This is a story about family and friendship, truth and secrets, and love. But it is not necessarily a love story. Do you think that on some level all stories are love stories?</p> <p><strong>JJ:</strong> Yes. Not all stories are romances, certainly, but all good stories are love stories, in one way or another. &#x201c;Only connect,&#x201d; E. M. Forster said, and at these words, a great Amen rises in me.</p> <p><strong>CBK:</strong> Your characters have definite musical tastes&#x2014;The Pixies, early David Bowie, They Might Be Giants. Are you promoting your own favorite bands through Shandi?</p> <p><strong>JJ:</strong> I am a visual arts person, a museum person. I am much more interested in seeing than hearing. I have embarrassingly pedestrian musical tastes; I listen to cheery pop with my eleven year old daughter. I like music that doesn&#x2019;t ask me to pay much attention to it. As I write this, Pandora is playing &#x201c;Jungle Love&#x201d; for me. I am chagrined to report that I just thumbsed it up. </p> <p>All the bands mentioned came from hanging out with my husband, my niece Erin Virginia, and my cool friend Lydia. I know this music because it matters so much to them, and they matter so much to me. I used their bands and songs to say things about the characters---not me. </p> <p><strong>CBK: </strong> Your contemporary novel deals with an ancient concept: the miracle. Do you believe in miracles? </p> <p><strong>JJ:</strong> Absolutely. <i>Someone Else's Love Story</i> is full of huge, overblown miracles. A virgin birth, a holy sacrifice, more than one resurrection. But they are all fake. They are all explained away and undercut. They are dust.</p> <p>The real miracles are smaller. There are at least two in this book, so tiny it is easy to miss them. They are very true and dear and frail and human. They spark and pop for only a moment before they begin to diffuse and spread themselves like mist into the story. They change everything. </p><p><em>I fell in love with William Ashe at gunpoint, in a Circle K</em></p><p>For single mom Shandi Pierce, life is a juggling act.

The son of a rabbi, Klemperer was by 1933 a professor of languages in Dresden. Over the next decade he, like other German Jews, lost his job, his house and many of his friends, even his cat, as Jews were not allowed to own pets. He remained loyal to his country, determined not to emigrate, and convinced that each successive Nazi act against the Jews must be the last. Saved for much of the war from the Holocaust by his marriage to a gentile, he was able to escape in the aftermath of the Allied bombing of Dresden and survived the remaining months of the war in hiding. Throughout, Klemperer kept a diary, for a Jew in Nazi Germany a daring act in itself. Shocking and moving by turns, it is a remarkable and important document, as powerful and astonishing in its way as Anne Frank's classic.<p>The second volume of two, this covers the period from the beginnings of the Holocaust to the end of the war, telling the story of Klemperer's increasing isolation, his near miraculous survival, his awareness of the development of the growing Holocaust as friends and associates disappeared, and his narrow escapes from deportation and the Dresden firebombing in 1945.</p></p><p>Born in 1881, Victor Klemperer studied in Munich, Geneva and Paris. He was a journalist in Berlin, taught at the University of Naples and received a DSM during WWI as a volunteer in the German army. He was subsequently a professor of romance languages at the Dresden Technical College until he was dismissed as a consequence of Nazi laws in 1935. He survived the Holocaust and the war and taught again as an academic until his death in 1960.</p><h2>The Fallen Sky: An Intimate History of Shooting Stars</h2><p>An award-winning founder of Isotope magazine chronicles how the study of meteorites became a modern science, in a natural history that documents the contributions of key individuals and traces landmark discoveries in Antarctica, Greenland, and other world regions.</p><p>Christopher Cokinos is an award-winning writer and poet, and a professor of English at Utah State University. He has received the Whiting Writers&#x2019; Award, the Glasgow Prize for an emerging writer in nonfiction, and the Sigurd Olson Nature Writing Award.In 1894, fifteen years before his storied expedition to the North Pole, Robert Peary crossed a treacherous expanse of ice in Greenland in search of another prize: a massive meteorite laden with rare metals from outer space. In this hefty, industrious book, Cokinos retraces Peary&#x2019;s steps, and those of other meteor &#x201c;obsessives,&#x201d; in an idiosyncratic hunt of his own. The book pairs, sometimes awkwardly, exciting tales of scientific adventure and unself-conscious rumination&#x2014;particularly on the subject of the author&#x2019;s failed first marriage, the pain of which, he insists, is &#x201c;part and parcel of the hunt, my hunt, for the meteorite hunters.&#x201d; As often as not, though, the original meteorite hunters had a more prosaic view of their quests. Peary, for instance, had a simple desire for glory and riches; when he finally found that meteorite, which the local Inuits had dubbed Woman (another, nearby, they called Dog), he called it &#x201c;the brown mass.&#x201d;</p><h2>Spirit, The - Achives VOL 17</h2><p>Collects stories from classic Spirit adventures in which a murdered detective fights crime from beyond the grave.</p><p>The latest volume reprinting Eisner's 1940s masked-crimefighter classic includes some of the most celebrated stories of the comic's 12-year run. Among them are tales of two of Eisner's most dangerous femmes fatale, treacherous French nightclub dancer Plaster of Paris and Lorelei Rox, a siren who lured truck drivers to their doom, and one of Eisner's personal favorites, the story of nebbishy Gerhard Shnobble, who miraculously took flight, to the world's utter disregard. The less-renowned pieces here deliver their rewards, too. By this time, eight years into <i>The Spirit</i>, Eisner was sending the hero to such exotic locales as Latin American "crook sanctuary" Caramba, "crime capital of the world"; south of the border, where the Spirit masqueraded as a matador; and out west, where he donned cowboy togs to track down a legendary gunslinger. Eisner's hallmark cinematic layouts, expressive drawing, and singular blending of drama and comedy were at their zenith. Libraries unwilling to spring for all 20-plus volumes of this landmark project at least ought to pick up this showcase of vintage Eisner. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From his spare yet enigmatic forms of the 1960s to his complex, multi-faceted assemblages and installations of more recent years, Tuttle's primary impetus throughout has been to craft unique objects, using everyday, often ephemeral materials, that demand to be confronted on their own terms. The relentless individuality of his aesthetic vision has earned him standing as one of the most provocative and influential artists of his day. This richly illustrated and strikingly designed catalogue, the most authoritative volume ever published on this prolific artist, presents nearly 400 reproductions of artworks from across his oeuvre and documentary photographs of his creative process. Essays by a distinguished group of writers trace the arc of Tuttle's career from its inception in the 1960s to the present day, addressing topics such as the philosophical underpinnings of his artistic method; his sensitive handling of diverse materials; his lifelong engagement with drawing and its expansion into three-dimensional space; his groundbreaking solo exhibitions and their critical reception in the United States and Europe; his complex play with the conventions of language; and his innovative artist's books, many of which are collaborations with poets.<br><i>The Art of Richard Tuttle</i> is published in conjunction with a major retrospective organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

How can universality be reformulated now that its spurious versions have been so thoroughly criticized? In this ground-breaking project, Judith Butler, Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj i ek engage in a dialogue on central questions of contemporary philosophy and politics. Their essays, organized as separate contributions that respond to one another, range over the Hegelian legacy in contemporary critical theory, the theoretical dilemmas of multiculturalism, the universalism-versus-particularism debate, the strategies of the Left in a globalized economy, and the relative merits of post-structuralism and Lacanian psychoanalysis for a critical social theory. While the rigor and intelligence with which these writers approach their work is formidable, <i>Contingency, Hegemony, Universality</i> benefits additionally from their clear sense of energy and enjoyment in a revealing and often unpredictable exchange.</p><p><b>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</b> is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic.

A child lovingly bids au revoir to the many extended family members he sees in nature: "Goodnight Papa Star /Goodnight Mama Moon / Bending your silver arms / down through the darkness." The non-rhyming quatrains of Carlstrom's poetry possess a soothing, lilting quality, perfect for quiet reading times. In sync with her expression of the philosophy of Alaska's native peoples--we are one with all living things--the Dillons have masterfully personified earth and sky. A tiny stone cabin, chimney smoking, in the foreground of each scene gives perspective to the sweeping, iridescent paintings. Cool nighttime hues of blue, purple and green cloak a cast of brown-skinned Alaskan natives. Stars and snowflakes shimmer in the black sky, while a blanket of white snow reflects colors with a silvery glow. Typifying a child's point of view, Grandpa Mountain is depicted as an old man straightening his nightcap, while Auntie Birch is a generation younger, and Sister Owl is shown as a child. The Dillons' work here most closely resembles their style in The Tale of the Mandarin Ducks , though each book has a distinct ethnic flavor. Refreshingly, this title's multicultural elements are informative without being intrusive: Alaskan figures wear native dress that includes elaborate animal costumes embellished with traditional geometric designs, though the peoples' origins are not belabored in the text. Literal-minded young readers may have questions about the interpretation of nature here, but this small point is hardly a detraction from this stunning, seamlessly executed work.

Yet despite the unbridled slanders and attacks against the faith, one powerful truth is undeniable: if Christ had never been born, nearly every facet of human life would be much more miserable than it is today. Arranged topically and presenting compelling, little-known historical facts, <em>What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?</em> clearly demonstrates that an enormous array of benefits to humankind-from economics to art to government, science to civil liberties, morality to health, and beyond-would never have occurred had Jesus Christ not lived.</p><p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Ancestral Machines: A Humanity&#39;s Fire Novel</h2><p><b>A new standalone epic space opera, set in the same world as the Humanity's Fire trilogy. </b><br><i>No world is safe.</i><b><br></b>The Warcage: two hundred worlds harnessed to an articial sun in a feat of unprecedented stellar engineering.

However, this is the only book to explain the complexities of the science and technology of wine in simple terms, and therefore fills a gap in the large market of wine information by making wine's technical mysteries accessible to those with no scientific education. This new edition brings the literature up-to-date, relaying in its plainspoken tradition the recent advances in wine science and technology. The topics covered range from the secrets of the vineyard, the processing of grapes to produce juice, the intricacies of fermentation, stabilization of the resulting wine, treatments, quality control and quality assurance, and bottling.</p><p>David Bird is a Chartered Chemist and Master of Wine.

As one of the few survivors he has spent much of his life studying Nazism and the Holocaust, but always as a discipline requiring the greatest coldness and objectivity, with his personal story set to one side. But he has remained haunted by specific memories and images, thoughts he has been unable to shake off. Translated by Ralph Mandel. &#39;The greatest book on Auschwitz since Primo Levi ... Kulka has achieved the impossible&#39; - the panel of Judges, Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize</p><p>Otto Dov Kulka was born in Czechoslovakia in 1933. He is Professor Emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.The greatest book on Auschwitz since Primo Levi ... Kulka has achieved the impossible: a mythological and strangely beautiful new language for living with Auschwitz ... a book as mighty as it is modest -- Panel of Judges, Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize Of the many accounts of survival in the Nazi concentration camps - Jewish and non-Jewish - few approach Otto Dov Kulka&#39;s for the quality of its writing and attempt to understand the nature of contemporary barbarism ... one of the essential books of our age; not since Primo Levi&#39;s The Periodic Table has there been such a powerful holocaust memoir ... the writing, at times trance-like, creates an extraordinary sense of communion and intimacy with the reader ... in pained but lucid prose Kulka seeks to understand how his memory processed the trauma of Auschwitz -- Ian Thomson * Telegraph * &#39;A poetic masterpiece unlike anything else written on the subject&#39; -- Simon Schama * Telegraph BOOKS OF THE YEAR * This is one of the most remarkable testimonies to inhumanity that I know. The deeply moving recollections of Dov Kulka&#39;s boyhood years in Auschwitz, interwoven with reflections of elegiac, poetic quality, vividly convey the horror of the death-camp, the trauma of family and friends, and the indelible imprint left on the memory of a young boy who became a distinguished historian of the Holocaust. An extraordinarily important work which needs to be read -- Sir Ian Kershaw Astonishing ... [Landscapes] is, quite simply, extraordinary ... a sort of Modernist precipitate of a historical work, something strange and powerful formed from, but separate to, the solution of history ... I can&#39;t see how this book could be bettered -- Robert Eaglestone * Times Higher Education * Almost unclassifiable ... Nothing else I have read comes close to this profound examination of what the Holocaust means ... [Kulka&#39;s] journey strikes me as a quest similar to the attempt to describe the face of God or the structure of the universe. They are too vast and too mysterious. Not that this stops us, or this author, from trying -- Linda Grant * New Statesman * Primo Levi&#39;s testimony, it is often said, is that of a chemist: clear, cool, precise, distant. So with Kulka&#39;s work: this is the product of a master historian - ironic, probing, present in the past, able to connect the particular with the cosmic. His memory is in the service of deep historical understanding, rendered in evocative prose that is here eloquently translated from Hebrew -- Thomas Laqueur * Guardian * Beautiful, startling ... This is a great book: read it. And be grateful - its publication is, in every possible sense, a miracle ... It is the strange and shocking paradox, this child&#39;s world constructed in such proximity to death, that makes the book so startling and so beautiful. Every incident is, in effect, seen twice: through the eyes of the historian and the eyes of a boy ... This is not history, it is something else... his words enter the wider sphere of literature -- Bryan Appleyard * Sunday Times * Kulka&#39;s reflections have an unsettling rawness ... yet even in Auschwitz, there are moments of protest, black humour and beauty ... This is a grave, poetic and horrifying account of the Holocaust which does not so much revisit the Auschwitz of the past, but the Auschwitz of Kulka&#39;s inner world -- Arifa Akbar * Independent * This is not so much a book about Auschwitz as one about coming to terms with the shock of survival ... Amid fragmentary, digressive impressions are images of terrible poetic concreteness ... What, ultimately, makes Kulka&#39;s book unlike any other first-hand account written about the camps is the authenticity of its vision of an 11-year-old boy... He has done the rest of us - and the world - so great a kindness by writing his book ... offer[ing] the barest glint of sunlight amid a thunderous darkness -- Simon Schama * Financial Times * A book of moments, hauntings and dreams ... it is unremitting and touches us all [with] a hallucinatory power * The Times * Otto Dov Kulka&#39;s brief, beautiful and unsettling Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death brings together childhood memories of Auschwitz with the reflections of a historian who has spent his life working on the Holocaust: a masterly interrogation of memory and the limitations of historical detachment -- Roy Foster * Times Literary Supplement BOOKS OF THE YEAR * A historian&#39;s memoir of Auschwitz, without sentimentality and almost without outrage, since it is an examination of a place where all human reactions are inadequate ... an overwhelming testimony to the human love of truth -- Andrew Brown * Guardian * For the first time, [Kulka] has turned his academic eye inward to explore as unflinchingly as possible the ways in which his childhood encounter with Auschwitz has affected him. Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death makes for deeply disturbing but ultimately very rewarding reading, and is unlike any Holocaust memoir I have ever come across ... The book is not a memoir in the conventional sense, but an extraordinary collection of some of the memories, ideas and dreams that make up Kulka&#39;s internal landscape -- Keith Lowe * Telegraph * In this short, powerful memoir, every word tells its story * Daily Mail * The term memoir barely seems adequate to the introspective, often poetic, sometimes hallucinatory moments that [Landscapes] captures ... such an important contribution to the literature on the Holocaust ... [it] unsettles presuppositions about the camp and its lasting psychological effects so thoroughly that even a reader steeped in the Holocaust canon is likely to experience a sense of defamiliarisation * Sydney Review of Books *</p><h2>Bull of the Woods: The Gordon Gibson Story</h2><p>310 pages of excellent text, filled with great photos and illustrations.

Once again, the hero is the historical figure Ambrose Bierce, William Randolph Hearst&#39;s star journalist and San Francisco&#39;s most celebrated writer. This time Bierce is investigating the disappearance of a Hawaiian princess attached to King Kalakaua&#39;s entourage. While the aged king slowly expires in the Palace Hotel&#39;s Royal Suite, San Francisco plays host to a throng of Hawaiian royal courtiers and counselors embroiled in a swirl of political intrigue surrounding the successor to the throne. As Bierce and his protege, Tom Redmond, search for the missing princess, Hall weaves a wonderfully tangled narrative of murder and mystery. Intelligent, gripping, and often very funny, Ambrose Bierce and the Death of Kings will appeal to all readers of mysteries, adventure tales, and historical novels.</p><p>Oakley Hall is the author of more than twenty works of fiction, including <b>Warlock</b>, <b>Separations</b>, and the <b>Ambrose Bierce</b> mystery series. Hall is best known for <b>The Downhill Racer</b>, basis for the 1969 Robert Redford film of the same name. Hall was the Director of Programs in Writing at the University of California at Irvine for twenty years. He is also director of the Squaw Valley Community of Writers and, in 1998, received a PEN Center USA/West Award for lifetime literary achievement. He lives in San Francisco.While King Kalakaua of Hawaii lies dying in a San Francisco hotel room, celebrated author-cum-detective Ambrose Bierce and his young companion, Tom Redmond, get the call to find a missing member of the royal entourage in this entertaining, if choppy, historical set during the winter of 1890-91. As in Hall's first novel in the series, Ambrose Bierce and the Queen of Spades (1998), Redmond plays an engaging Watson to Bierce's Holmes. Redmond falls in love with the "monumental" Haunani Brown, a beautiful Hawaiian who is visiting her uncle, California poet Edward Browne. Simultaneously, millionaire Aaron Underwood hires Bierce to find Princess Leileiha, who's betrothed to potential heir to the throne Alexander Honomoku and is a close friend of Haunani. The two threads of the story romance and mystery are woven inevitably, expertly, together. Since the king has named no successor, the fate of Hawaii as well as that of U.S. imperial aspirations, and the ambitions of Underwood's father, the frightful sugar baron Silas Underwood hangs in the balance. Not surprisingly, murder, mayhem and even magic come into play. The sprinkling of old-fashioned and Hawaiian terms throughout the text, such as "instanter" and the delightful "panipani," adds period flavor. The author, alas, breaks up the narrative with short expository sections that read like nothing so much as afterthoughts. On the whole, though, this book makes for a captivating rollick through Old Frisco. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Home Guide to Cartridge Conversions</h2><p>This is the classic book with all the information needed to make hundreds of different calibers.

With access to the Field Marshal&#39;s private papers, including his letters, diaries and military records, Nigel Hamilton has delved into the heart and soul of the man who, though vain and difficult, was driven by a determination to spare men&#39;s lives by insisting on proper planning and rehearsal.</p><p>Despite grave character flaws (he was vain, arrogant, small-minded and vengeful) Montgomery was, according to Hamilton, the outstanding Allied battlefield commander of WW II. Hamilton ( JFK: Reckless Youth ) has condensed his three-volume official biography into this single, more accessible book for general readers, concentrating both on Montgomery's battlefield exploits and his thorny relationships with American generals Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley. Hamilton describes how and why Montgomery deliberately humiliated the latter and disparaged the former, his direct superior, almost continually accusing Eisenhower of everything from ignorance to incompetence. The biography is decidedly controversial: Hamilton argues, for instance, that Eisenhower was virtually inactive during the major German counterattack in the Ardennes and charges Bradley with concocting self-serving myths about Montgomery that would dominate postwar writing on the Western alliance. This shortened version brings into clearer focus the reasons for the high regard in which students of the military art hold Montgomery. Photos. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.A condensation of Hamilton's previous three-volume biography of Montgomery -Monty: The Making of a General (LJ 9/15/81), Master of the Battlefield (LJ 1/84), and Monty: Final Years of the Field Marshal (LJ 12/86)-this latest effort will be more accessible to the average American reader. Sympathetic to Montgomery, while recognizing his personality flaws and peculiarities, this title provides a view of Montgomery that may be unfamiliar in the United States-that of a dedicated professional soldier and ally baffled by the perceived weakness and amateurism of U.S. political and military leaders during World War II. Arrogant, vain, and caustic, Montgomery remains one of the least-understood, yet most successful, Allied military figures of the war. Hamilton's book can serve to provide an alternative view to the usual Eisenhower-oriented materials and should be considered for World War II collections.---Stanley Planton, Quinn Lib, Univ.<br><i>Chillicothe</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>With No One As Witness (A Lynley Novel)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;[A] juicy serial killer whodunit.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>USA Today</em></p><p>&#x201c;Delicately textured...achingly compassionate....It&#x2019;s one of George&#x2019;s best, and that&#x2019;s saying something.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Seattle Times </em></p><p>The 13th novel in Elizabeth George&#x2019;s acclaimed, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Inspector Linley crime fiction series, <em>With No One as Witness</em> is arguably the most riveting, shocking, and emotionally compelling of the lot. The hunt for a serial killer who has been murdering and mutilating young boys in London has Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley and his team of investigators racing to stop the slaughter, only to have the investigation nearly derailed by one devastating, truly game changing event. An American author, George has been praised as &#x201c;a master of the British mystery&#x201d; by the <em>New York Times</em>, one of only two Yanks whose crime novels have been adapted for the PBS TV series, &#x201c;Mystery,&#x201d;&nbsp; and her exceptional police procedurals rank with the best of Ian Rankin, Peter Robinson, and Ruth Rendell.<br></p></p><p><p>The police never suspected a serial killer was at large until they found the third murdered boy, the first white victim, his body draped over a tomb in a London graveyard. Suddenly a series of crimes <em>and</em> a potential public relations disaster have Scotland Yard on the defensive, scrambling to apprehend a maniac while avoiding accusations of racism. </p><p>Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley, distracted by concerns for his pregnant wife, has been assigned to the investigation, along with his disgraced partner, Barbara Havers, who's fighting for her professional future. Winston Nkata, deservedly, if hastily, promoted to detective sergeant, is the black face who will speak to the media. But none of them can imagine the tenacity and ingenuity of the killer they seek . . . and no one is prepared for the savage, shocking instant when everything will change forever.</p><p>Elizabeth George is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of sixteen novels of psychological suspense, one book of nonfiction, and two short story collections.

To Mendocino comes museum curator Howard Barton in search of the McGuffin of the title, a sketch (?) with magical powers held by mysterious recluse Michael Graham. But when Howard arrives, Graham has vanished (supposedly a suicide); the weird Mr. Jimmers, inventor of a machine that materializes ghosts, now occupies his clifftop house. Howard calls on his penniless, oddball uncle Roy, former proprietor of a spirit museum, who's fighting a desperate, losing battle against the rapacious magnate and witch Heloise Lamey--she also covets the sketch. As Howard becomes romantically involved with Roy's daughter Sylvia, he struggles to make sense of the increasingly odd occurrences and to decide whose side he's on: When old Graham really dies, Howard is destined to become the sketch's new Keeper. Rather arcane in places and curiously lacking in thematic ambition, but seamlessly produced: intriguing and absorbing work from a major talent. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Despite a misleadingly slow and uninspiring beginning, this supernatural thriller is enjoyable: a combination of Charles William's books War in Heaven and The Greater Trumps, but moved to a small town in Northern California. Here the Holy Grail is actually an origami cup which, folded to form different shapes, provides the owner with diverse powers. A quiet group of ordinary people have been helping Michael Graham, its guardian, to protect it. When Graham is about to die of old age, the Grail summons Howard Barton to visit his relatives and take over its guardianship. Of course, he has no idea that he has been summoned, nor even that the Grail exists, but neither factor stops Heloise Lamey and her greedy crew from using Howard to attempt to obtain the Grail for themselves. Blaylock ( The Last Coin ) redeems the familiarity of his plot with a gift for drawing characters who are eccentric in delightful and original ways, whichever side of the war they are on. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Weekends With the Impressionists: A Collection from the National Gallery of Art, Washington</h2><p>The impressionists left a celebrated and much-loved legacy of paintings that depict the pleasures of turn-of-the-century France.

C. Beaton's beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series&#x2015;now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.</p><p>Bossy, impulsive, and unlucky in love, the all-too-human Agatha Raisin has proved to be a surprisingly effective---and endearing---amateur sleuth. But can Agatha make it as a private investigator? After getting mugged on vacation, in what she will always think of as the Paris Incident, she decides to find out.</p><p>Agatha soon learns that running her own detective agency in the Cotswolds is not quite like starring in a Raymond Chandler movie. Instead of dames in distress with big shoulder pads, her clients are ladies with missing cats and a man whose son has run off with his car. Agatha even worries that she might be outclassed by her sixty-seven-year-old secretary, Emma Comfrey.<br>But then wealthy divorc�e Catherine Laggat-Brown walks in with their first "real" case. Mrs. Laggat-Brown's daughter has received a death threat, and when Agatha thwarts an attack on the girl at a dinner dance, she recognizes an opportunity to show what Raisin Investigations can do. Even better, the case gives her a chance to reunite with her long-absent friend, Sir Charles Fraith. As they scour the Cotswolds in search of leads, Charles' insights prove invaluable and his charms irresistible, leading poor Emma to fall madly in love with him.</p><p>As ever, Agatha bumbles her way through the case, trying her friends' patience and flirting shamelessly with the chief suspect. Will she put her tiny agency on the map, or has even the outrageous Agatha finally bitten off more than she can chew?</p></p><p><p><b><i>She's outclassed, outmatched, and outgunned </i></b></p><p>Infuriated that her holiday was ruined by a mugging, Agatha Raisin decides to open up her own detective agency. The romance-minded sleuth is thrilled by visions of handsome fellow gumshoes and headline-making crimes but soon finds the only cases she can get are a non-glamorous lot of lost cats and an errant teenager. But when a wealthy divorcee hires the agency to investigate a death threat against her daughter Cassandra, Agatha thwarts a vicious attack on the heiress bride. Now Agatha is in hot pursuit of the culprit. But when the groom's father turns up dead, Agatha must untangle a growing list of suspects, from Carsely's quiet village lanes to Paris' most fashionable streets. Soon the willfully undaunted Agatha is in trouble with French <i>and</i> British police; on the outs (again) with old friends and dead in the sights of a murderer.</p><p><b>"Anyone interested in intelligent, amusing reading will want to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Agatha Raisin."</b><br><b> </b><i><b>Atlanta</b></i><b><i> Journal Constitution</i></b></p><p><b>"I simply love mysteries that have all the requirements necessary to make them great the characters, the action, the plots, and that thing we call humanity.

Benjamin Lorr walked into his first yoga studio on a whim, overweight and curious, and quickly found the yoga reinventing his life. He was studying Bikram Yoga (or "hot yoga") when a run-in with a master and competitive yoga champion led him into an obsessive subculture&#x2015;a group of yogis for whom eight hours of practice a day in 110- degree heat was just the beginning.</p><p>So begins a journey. Populated by athletic prodigies, wide-eyed celebrities, legitimate medical miracles, and predatory hucksters, it's a nation-spanning trip&#x2015;from the jam-packed studios of New York to the athletic performance labs of the University of Oregon to the stage at the National Yoga Asana Championship, where Lorr competes for glory. </p><p>The culmination of two years of research, and featuring hundreds of interviews with yogis, scientists, doctors, and scholars, <i>Hell-Bent</i> is a wild exploration. A look at the science behind a controversial practice, a story of greed, narcissism, and corruption, and a mind-bending tale of personal transformation, it is a book that will not only challenge your conception of yoga, but will change the way you view the fragile, inspirational limits of the human body itself.</p></p><p>BENJAMIN LORR graduated from Columbia University with a degree in environmental biology and creative writing.

He thought of civilized and morally tolerable human life as a dangerous walk on a thin crust of barely cooled lava which at any moment might break and let the unwary sink into fiery depths.

Sure the blood starts pressing down on your face, and the floor and all its weird grainy ephemera are a whole lot closer, but in general, your body adjusts. Your breathing relaxes; your brain sort of shrugs. When you look around, things don&#x2019;t appear upside down. They appear as things. That&#x2019;s a woman siting in Lotus, there&#x2019;s a radiator, a row of mirrors, a pair of leopard-print Lycra shorts, someone&#x2019;s irregularly bulging poorly shaven crotch.<br>At the moment, I&#x2019;m upside down, marveling at this fact, staring at these things. Across the room from me, Kara is going into her regular seizure. Lauren, two people down, is weeping softly to herself. Michael Jackson is pumping on the sound system. He&#x2019;s telling us &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Stop &#x2019;Til You Get Enough.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve heard the song my whole life, but right now, belly-button to the sky, and back bent in a shape far closer to a V than the desirable and healthy U I&#x2019;m aiming for, I decide he&#x2019;s a prophet. A glowing saint. His voice is so fucking pure, so enthusiastic and happy, it&#x2019;s difficult for me to hold it all together listening to him. As I rise out of my backbend, uncurling to a standing position, I feel a wave of electricity, a shiver up my spine. The room in front of me goes wavy like a reflection in water; blue and red dots flood my vision. Behind and between these, staring straight back at me from the mirror, is my smile. I watch, amazed at the size of my grin. Then I inhale, stretch to the ceiling, and dive backwards for more.<br>We&#x2019;re all here&#x2014;weeping, smiling, twitching on the carpet while experiencing profound neurological events&#x2014;because we are training to become yoga champions. Literally. Not in any elliptical, analogous, or absurdist sense. But actual trophy-wielding champions. This is Backbending Club, a semisecret group of super-yogis who gather together from across the Bikram universe to push one another to the limits of their practice. It&#x2019;s a little like the Justice League, Davos, or TED, only for yoga practice. For two weeks at a time, otherwise dedicated citizens&#x2014;husbands, shopgirls, bankers&#x2014;strip out of their pantsuits and ties, shed all civilian attachments, strap on Speedos, and dedicate their lives to asana practice.<br>Backbenders are not like you and me. These are practitioners for whom two classes a day is an unsatisfactory beginning. Who sneak third sets into regular class. Who stay long after everyone else has left. Who work on postures quietly in the corner until the studio owner gently asks them to put on some clothes and leave. Bodies so finely muscled, so devoid of fat that they&#x2019;re basically breathing anatomical diagrams. Innards so clean, their shit comes out with the same heft, virtue, and scent of a ripe cucumber. Almost every studio has at least one practitioner like this. You know them by their works. By the way you eye them when you are trying not to. By the purely curious way you wonder what skin that tightly upholstered actually feels like. And if your gym, studio, or workplace doesn&#x2019;t have an actual Backbender, it certainly has someone with backbending in her heart. Who desperately wants to go hard-core, if only someone would give her permission.<br>Backbending Club is what happens when this community of loners crash together. We are here now in Charleston, South Carolina. Local studio owner David Kiser is hosting. To host, David has opened his home and studio to the group for the next two weeks. We take class at his studio, carefully cramming ourselves into the back of the room so as to disturb his regular students as little as possible. In between classes, we practice further. Then we take class again. Then we continue to practice, often not returning to his home until after midnight.<br>In this respect, Backbending is the antithesis of those glossy lavender-scented <i>Yoga Journal</i> retreats. We eat; we do yoga. There are no catered meals, no spacious rooms, no hammock time, no sandy beaches. No refined sugar, no alcohol, no processed foods. No coherent schedule, no personal space, no sarcasm, and no coffee. There are also no fees. Participants pay what they can, when they can.<br>Right now, surrounded by those hallucinatory red and blue dots, we are wall-walking. For the uninitiated, this means standing with your back to a wall, reaching upward to the ceiling, dropping your head back like a Pez dispenser, and slowly curling your spine backwards. I imagine peeling a banana. To guide yourself as you peel, you walk your hands down the wall. First your head goes past your neck, then your hips, then your knees. Finally, your face ends up on a flat plane with your feet, and your chest is pressed against the wall. It is not a yoga pose. It is an exercise Backbenders practice to increase the range of motion in the spine. By leveraging the pressure of the floor and gravity, each wall-walk pushes the spine into a deeper and deeper backbend.<br>Michael Jackson is paused. The room goes suddenly silent except for our breathing.<br>&#x201c;Everyone look at Karlita.&#x201d;<br>Twenty-two heads turn. It takes me a second to find her because my internal gyroscope is spinning a lot faster than the room, which it turns out isn&#x2019;t actually spinning. Finally, in the far corner, I find Karla Gonz�lez&#x2014;a twelve-year-old who flew in from Mexico City. Karla, looking a bit like an insect, is in the logical conclusion of a wall-walk: on her chest, ankles on each side of her ears, feet flat on the floor. She has a sweaty agonized look on her face I usually associate with women giving birth. She does not look like she wants us to be looking at her.<br>&#x201c;Now come up slowly. Finish with your arms last.&#x201d;<br>Keeping her ankles in one place, Karla pushes up from her chest and uncurls to a standing position like a slow-motion pea shoot sprouting from the soil. Suddenly, she is a twelve-year-old girl again. Her face flushes as the entire room applauds. I have the distinct urge to tell her that I love her. Instead, I inhale and try to stabilize the internal gyroscope so as not to puke.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The voice instructing Karla belongs to Esak Garcia. At thirty-four, Esak is a legitimate Bikram Yoga celebrity, the guru&#x2019;s favorite son. His body ripples like a snake when he moves, his torso the keeper of a thousand muscles I have never seen before. Esak attended Bikram&#x2019;s very first teacher training as a teenager&#x2014;just before heading off to college at Yale&#x2014;and returns to training every year, twice a year, to, in his words, refresh from the source. More to the point, Esak is also an authentic yoga champion, the first male to have won the international competition, having bent his way to the top in 2005. He is one of the very few Bikramites authorized by the guru to run seminars and is constantly flying around the world giving lectures, demonstrating postures, and gently guiding the spines of the middle-age practitioners willing to pony up his speaking fees.<br>Backbending Club is a different space. Unlike his seminars, it is an invitation into his personal practice. It is the yoga community he hopes to build. The work here is a refinement of the program he used when training for the championship in 2005. That is the reason for the do-it-yourself mentality, Byzantine dietary restrictions, and the donation-only payment plan. Esak is here to practice; he invites like-minded members of the community to support him.<br>While we wall-walk, Esak bends along with us but out of time. We go down the wall, he stays up watching, giving corrections. When we come up, we see only his stomach and pelvis arching outward. His eyes have a peripheral vision that brings to mind a frog&#x2019;s tongue zipping out to catch flies. He can be across the room, holding down a conversation, scrutinizing a posture, when suddenly he will yell out a correction in response to your first, tiniest mismovement. A slippage from exhaustion, a momentary cheat. A week into the training, these staccato barks are really the only one-on-one interaction I have had with him.<br>As we wind down tonight&#x2019;s set of wall-walks, Esak puts Michael on pause once again.<br>&#x201c;I know you all are in pain. I know because I can see it in your faces; I know because I am there too. But remember, this is why we are here. Each of us needs to find the painful place and go through it. Do not try to avoid it.&#x201d; He pauses. &#x201c;The pain is temporary. It is a phantom. But if you avoid it, you will never move past it.&#x201d;<br>As he speaks, I look around the room. At least three of the women bending on the wall next to me have little blue X&#x2019;s of surgical tape peeking out from below their sport bras. The surgical tape was put there by a chiropractor earlier in the day. The women are doing backbends so severe their ribs are popping out of place. The chiropractor pops them back in and the women return for more backbends. I know this because as one of the only people with a car, I drive them to and from the studio when it happens.<br>When I drive the women to the chiropractor, I worry about Esak&#x2019;s pain rhetoric. It feels like the worst type of adolescent masochism, Nietzsche filtered through David Blaine. But at the moment, smiley and vibrating with joy, I know exactly what he is talking about. I know because if I let my concentration slip for a second, my whole bo...</p><h2>A Cat&#39;s Little Instruction Book</h2><p>A collection of 201 bits of feline wisdom features such sage cat advice as &#34;When in doubt, chase something,&#34; &#34;Be astonishingly mysterious,&#34; &#34;Help with jigsaw puzzles,&#34; &#34;Let sleeping dogs lie,&#34; and others. 75,000 first printing. $50,000 ad/promo.

Serena had crossed a country to find him, guided by her determination to become a master wizard. She knew he could be her teacher&#x2014;but she never expected the charismatic, seductive power that was Merlin's. Nor had she dreamed of the fire he ignited in her body and soul, a flame that burned even hotter than the powerful talent she possessed but did not yet understand. Their love forbidden by an ancient law, Serena and Richard will take a desperate gamble and travel to a long-lost world to change the history that threatens to separate them. But they risk being torn apart forever, destroyed by a cursed land...and their own fierce desires.</p><p>Kay Hooper is the award-winning author of <b>Sense of Evil</b>, <b>Touching Evil</b>, <b>Whisper of Evil</b>, <b>Once a Thief, Always a Thief</b>, the <i>Shadows</i> trilogy, and more. She lives in North Carolina where she is at work on the next installment in the <i>Fear</i> series.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>"Ten bucks says you can't do it."<br><br>Serena Smyth lifted an eyebrow at her friend, her catlike green eyes alight with amusement. "You're on."<br><br>It was one of many bets between the two young women since they had met in high school years before, lighthearted and, as usual, challenging Serena's uncanny ability to get information, or anything else she wanted, from a man.<br><br>Jane Riley, an attractive and vivacious brunet, giggled, but then suddenly looked nervous. "I don't know. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Serena, Jeremy Kane uses his column to trash anybody he hates, and since that model broke up with him, he hates every woman still alive and breathing. There's no way he'll dance with you, let alone spill the beans about the grant. And if he realizes you're just after information, next week's column will make you look like the whore of Babylon."<br><br>"He'll never guess what I'm after," Serena retorted confidently.<br><br>"Oh, no? Look, friend, we both know he's virtually pickled after years of drinking, but he was a crackerjack investigative reporter once upon a time, and some of the old instincts might still be there."<br><br>Serena shrugged. With the frankness that often startled people because her appearance made them believe she was too elegant and haughty to ever speak bluntly, she said, "I don't think he could find his butt with both hands and a flashlight."<br><br>Jane, knowing her friend rather well, began to regret her own impulsive challenge. "Serena, why don't we just forget the bet this time? If you go and do something crazy, Richard will never forgive me."<br><br>"Forgive you? Don't be silly, he knows me too well to ever blame anyone else for my tricks. Besides, you know you're dying to find out if Seth gets the grant."<br><br>Jane couldn't deny that. Seth Westcott was her live-in lover, an artist with a difficult temperament, and Jane knew their cluttered loft would be much more peaceful if she could tell him that the fifty-thousand-dollar grant from Kane's newspaper was going to be his. More peaceful for a while, at least.<br><br>But she hesitated, mostly because of Serena's uncle and onetime guardian, with whom her friend still lived here in Seattle. Richard Merlin had always made Jane feel just the tiniest bit uneasy, though she couldn't have said exactly why, since he'd always been perfectly pleasant to her. It might have been his dramatic appearance; his slightly shaggy black hair, austere, rather classical bone structure, and startling black eyes gave him the appearance of a man who might have been anything from a poet or maestro of the symphony&#x2013;to a serial killer.<br><br>In actuality, he was a businessman, involved in various real estate ventures, and both well known and highly respected in the city. A rather ordinary kind of career, certainly, and he had never done anything to call undue attention to himself or any of his actions. But Jane still felt curiously in awe of him, and it always made her nervous when Serena cheerfully did something they both knew her uncle would not be happy about.<br><br>Shaking her head, Jane said, "Of course I want to know if Seth gets the grant, but I'd rather not see your name in bold print in Kane's column."<br><br>"Oh, that'll never happen." Serena spoke absently, her attention elsewhere as she scanned the well-dressed crowd. The occasion was a dinner-dance charity benefit, and since the charity was a good one, the crowd was happy to be here. Both the food and the band were first-rate, and the party was being held in a hotel ballroom, so none of the guests felt the automatic constraint that came with being in someone's home.<br><br>The huge room was very noisy.<br><br>Serena finally found what she'd been looking for: Richard's tall form on the other side of the room. He was talking to the mayor, his attention firmly engaged, and was unlikely to notice what she was up to.<br><br>"If you're so sure Richard won't care what you're going to do," Jane said suspiciously, "then why did you check first to make sure he was across the room?"<br><br>Serena rose to her feet, leaving her wrap over the back of the chair and her evening purse on the table. She was a bit above average height and slender, but by no means thin. In fact, she could have earned a healthy income posing for the centerfold of any men's magazine, and the backless emerald green evening gown she was wearing displayed that eye-catching figure to advantage.<br><br>The gown also set off her bright red hair, currently swept up in an elaborate French twist, her translucent complexion, and her vivid green eyes. She was a beautiful woman, her features exquisite and deceptively haughty, and a considerable intelligence made her able to hold her own in most any situation.<br><br>Smiling, she looked down at her friend and said, "I never said he wouldn't care. I just said he wouldn't blame you."<br><br>Watching her friend move gracefully among the tables toward her intended target, Jane felt a brief, craven impulse to find Seth in the crowd and announce that she wanted to go home. But he'd be suspicious, and she'd have to confess she had dared Serena to do something dangerous. Again.<br><br>It had been fun during their teenage years, because Serena had accepted even the wildest dares and because peculiar things always seemed to happen when she did.<br><br>Like the time Jane had dared her to approach the famous rock star who'd been performing in Seattle. Serena had gotten past the guards at the stage door with incredible ease, emerging in triumph ten minutes later with an autograph. She had been wearing a stage pass, impossible to buy or fake, and had only laughed when Jane had demanded to know how she'd gotten it.<br><br>Later Jane had heard an odd story. The sprinkler system backstage had been acting up just when Serena had been there, going on and off in different areas randomly, drenching equipment and driving everybody nuts.<br><br>Serena, of course, had come out perfectly dry.<br><br>And there had been another occasion Jane had never forgotten. A mutual friend had taken the two girls out on a fishing boat, and he had bemoaned the fact that the small family fishing businesses such as his were a dying breed; they simply couldn't compete with the huge commercial operations. He was on the verge of going under financially, he had confided, and during this particular week the catch had been truly abysmal.<br><br>Jane had happened to look at Serena just then, and she'd been struck by her friend's expression. Gazing out over the water, Serena had chewed her bottom lip in a characteristically indecisive gesture and then, looking both guilty and pleased, had nodded to herself, her eyes very bright.<br><br>There had been no opportunity to ask her friend what was going on, because their host had begun to haul his nets in. To his obvious shock, the catch was the best of the season, incredibly good; the boat rode low in the water with the weight of the fish. It seemed his luck had turned. In fact, after that day he had only to cast out his nets to be rewarded by all the fish he could handle.<br><br>Jane had never asked Serena about that, just as she'd never asked her about a few other peculiar things, such as why light bulbs had an odd tendency to blow out near her and computers often went haywire, or why she couldn't wear a wristwatch (they went crazy or simply died on her), or why the weather always seemed to be good when she wanted it to be. Jane simply accepted the good fortune of Serena's friends and privately decided that she was three parts witch.<br><br>But she was nervous about this bet, and watched anxiously as Serena reached Jeremy Kane's table. The newspaperman had been drinking steadily all evening, and had more than once gotten so loud that those at nearby tables couldn't help overhearing him as he caustically held forth on a number of subjects. But he hadn't left his table even once to dance.<br><br>Jane saw her friend lean down to speak to Kane, but she didn't get the chance to observe his reaction, because her own date returned to their table just then.<br><br>"Sorry to be so long, honey," Seth said as he sat down beside her. "Thompson's wife had to tell me in great detail how she wanted her portrait to look." He was a tall, very thin man with average looks and deceptively mild brown eyes, and possessed only two unusual physical characteristics. His voice was so beautiful, it was nearly hypnotic; and his hands were incredibly graceful and expressive.<br><br>Jane had no trouble in fixing her attention on Seth; she was absolutely crazy about the man. "Megan Thompson? If she has any sense, she'd just ask you to make her look like somebody else."<br><br>Seth grinned at her. "Meow."<br><br>"She has mismatched eyes," Jane insisted. "Besides that, her ears are set too low, and she has dark roots."<br><br>Leaning back away from her in exaggerated caution, Seth said, "Whew&#x2013;what's with you? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were jealous. But I do know better, so I has to be something else."<br><br>"I just wish you didn't have to take commissions from people like that," Jane muttered.<br><br>Seth frowned suddenly. "I know that's the way you feel, Janie, but it isn't what's bugging you now. You look guilty as hell. What've you done?"<br><br>A sudden burst of laughter that was audible even over the music drew Jane's attention, and she saw Serena dancing quite gracefully in the arms of Jeremy Kane, even though he was indisputably drunk and loudly amused with something.<br><br>"What's Serena doing with Kane?" Seth wanted to know.<br><br>"Dancing, obviously."<br><br>"Smartass. You know damned well what I meant by that. It's bad enough that the man's a mean drunk, he also happens to write a syndicated column that's nothing less than a weekly character assassination. Serena's got no business anywhere around that son of a bitch."<br><br>Since Seth had seen his character assassinated in Kane's column some years previously, his bitterness was understandable.<br><br>Jane cleared her throat and tried not to look even more guilty. "Well, Kane's on the committee handing out that grant, you know."<br><br>Seth closed his eyes briefly and shook his head. "You dared her to go pump him for info, didn't you?"<br><br>"I didn't mean to, it just slipped out. Seth, do you think maybe you should go get her?"<br><br>"Why?" he asked, surprised.<br><br>"If she's in over her head&#x2013;"<br><br>With a short laugh Seth said, "Janie, you ought to know your friend better than that. With the possible exceptions of Richard and myself, Serena can wrap any man in the room around her little finger&#x2013;including Jeremy Kane, drunk or sober."<br><br>"Then why'd you say she had no business anywhere around him?" Jane asked, a bit indignant.<br><br>"Because it's true. I don't doubt she'll get whatever she's after from him, but she may be opening Pandora's box to do it. In case you haven't noticed, almost every curious eye in the room is on them. After the little stunt she pulled with that actor last year, her reputation isn't exactly the greatest. Flirting with Jeremy Kane won't help."<br><br>Ever loyal, Jane said, "I still say it wasn't Serena's fault that guy fell for her and made a fool of himself. What was she supposed to do when his publicist kept slyly hinting there'd soon be wedding bells?"<br><br>"She might have just waited until it all blew over," Seth noted dryly. "But, no, not our Serena. She had to take matters into her own hands. Calling a press conference to announce in no uncertain terms how hilarious she found the very idea of marrying the poor guy wasn't exactly subtle."<br><br>Jane started to respond, but changed her mind. Though she'd never said so to either Serena or Seth, Jane had the odd idea that some, if not all, of Serena's very public "affairs" during the past few years had been nothing more than a whole lot of smoke disguising little or no fire. As if she had quite deliberately painted the portrait of a woman who enjoyed men without getting serious about any of them.<br><br>That press conference, for instance&#x2013;Jane found it completely out of character. Serena was a private woman, yet she had deliberately sought out public attention and had presented herself as, at best, a woman careless with both her good name and the feelings of others. It was a wildly inaccurate characterization, as any of her friends would have attested, yet Serena had seemingly cultivated it.<br><br>For some reason known only to herself, Serena coolly and methodically sacrificed her reputation in order to protect something more important to her.<br><br>That was the feeling Jane had, but as close as they were, Jane had never challenged her friend on that point. Serena had a way of laughingly, but quite firmly, discouraging questions about topics she preferred not to discuss, and her love life was definitely hands off even to her best friend. Yet Jane wouldn't have been terribly surprised if Serena had confessed to being a virgin; there was a look of innocence in those bright green eyes, something unawakened, untouched.<br><br>Probably what attracted men so wildly, Jane had decided.<br><br>"Look at that," Seth was saying disgustedly. "She practically had to pour him into his chair. Huh. She has muscle under that lovely skin."<br><br>Jane wasn't dismayed or made jealous by the remark; she had learned a long time ago that Seth's appreciation of other women was aesthetic and impersonal.<br><br>"D'you think she'd sit for me?" he asked absently as he watched Serena coming toward them. That this sudden interest in Serena had come about because she had surprised him was characteristic of him. He generally preferred to paint people he didn't know rather than those he did, claiming that foreknowledge of a subject clouded his artistic perception.<br><br>"Only if you appeal to her sense of self-discovery, not her vanity," Jane advised. "Tell her you can show her something about herself she can't see in a mirror, and I'd bet she wouldn't hesitate to sit for you."<br><br>Seth nodded slightly and rose to hold Serena's chair for her, but when he spoke, it wasn't to entice her to pose for him. "It would serve you right if he drooled all down your neck," he said severely.<br><br>With a low laugh Serena said, "Well, he didn't. I'll have a slight bruise on the rear where he pinched me, but otherwise he was almost a perfect gentleman." Then she lifted an eyebrow at Jane. "You owe me ten bucks."<br><br>"What did he say?" Jane asked, forgetting everything but her eagerness to know about the grant.<br><br>Serena looked at Seth with a smile. "Congratulations."<br><br>His thin face lit up, but he shook his head. "How much faith should you place in the word of a drunk?"<br><br>"Very little," Serena agreed. "Which is why I'm glad he has the rough draft of the announcement in his pocket. The grant's yours, kiddo."<br><br>"I'm gonna go find some champagne," Seth said delightedly. He kissed Serena's cheek, then strode off in search of a bottle to celebrate his good fortune.<br><br>Jane had a streak of uncompromising logic in her nature, and that made itself apparent when she asked, "Why would he have a draft of the announcement in his pocket? It won't be made until next week."<br><br>"I don't know," Serena said, totally unconcerned. "But he has."</p><h2>Step Ball Change: A Novel</h2><p>With a ringing phone, Jeanne Ray&#x2019;s charming and amusing new novel gets off to a rollicking start that never lets up. Not for a minute. On the other end of the phone is Caroline&#x2019;s daughter, Kay, a public defender like her father, sobbing at the improbably good news that the richest, most eligible boy in Raleigh, North Carolina, has asked her to marry him. While Caroline and Tom are trying to digest this, the other phone, the &#x201c;children&#x2019;s line,&#x201d; rings; it is Caroline&#x2019;s sister, Taffy, hysterical over her husband&#x2019;s decision to leave her for a woman two years younger than her daughter. <br><br>Soon Taffy is wending her way up from Atlanta to seek solace in her sister&#x2019;s home, even though the two have been separated by more than just geography for the past forty years. With her is her little dog, Stamp, who has a penchant for biting ankles and stealing hearts. Tom and Caroline quickly realize that the wedding their future son-in-law&#x2019;s family is envisioning for nine-hundred-plus guests is to be their fiscal responsibility. To top it all off, the foundation of their home is in danger of collapsing and their contractor and his crew have all but moved in. It&#x2019;s a thundering whirlwind of emotion that finally boils down to: Who is in love with whom? and Who&#x2019;s going to get the next dance? <br><br>Wise, funny, and impossible to put down, <b>Step-Ball-Change</b> is peopled with characters you feel you have known your whole life. It&#x2019;s the kind of book that you can&#x2019;t bear to see end.</p><p>Jeanne Ray is a nurse living in Nashville, Tennessee, and the author of the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling novel Julie and Romeo.<b>Chapter one</b><br><br>It all started on Tuesday night. Tom and I were having dinner when the phone rang.<br><br>Let me stop here for a minute. I want to revel in that sentence. Tom and I were having dinner. It almost sounds like this was something that happened regularly. In fact, my husband, who is a public defender, had made a career of eating peanut-butter-cheese crackers from the vending machine in the Raleigh courthouse while he went over the testimony of guys named Spit one more time. I had been teaching adult tap classes in the evenings to young women who didn't have a date after work and were trying to improve themselves. That was not to say I was never home or Tom was never home, but it was hard to make it home simultaneously, and it was nearly impossible to be home alone. Our two oldest sons, Henry and Charlie, were married and gone, but George, our youngest, was still down the hall while he went to law school. Kay, our daughter, found her way over most nights to review cases with her father. And if none of the children were here, you could count on the fact that Woodrow, our contractor, and a couple of the plaster guys who worked for him would be sitting on the back porch having some fast food in the evening. Originally, Woodrow had come to build a glassed-in porch on the house, what we called a Florida room, but halfway through the project he discovered that our foundation had shifted, and suddenly the cracks that were deep below the ground were spreading across our walls like ambitious ivy. The Florida room was abandoned in favor of the more pressing problems, and now stood as a naked frame of skinny poles on the side of our house. We had been under construction for six weeks, and I had come to think of the workmen as distant relatives who wanted to leave but had no place else to go.<br><br>But tonight the house was dark. When Tom and I called out no one answered back. Woodrow was gone and George was gone and the drop cloths were neatly folded and stacked. To further raise the odds on the rarity of this evening, I had actually bought the ingredients to make a pasta dish with olives and real tuna that I had seen in a magazine. So when I say, "Tom and I were having dinner," I mean it was hot food, and we were alone together. Tom had been so hopeful as to put on a Stan Getz record, and "Girl from Ipanema" laced the air. The whole evening was a kind of far-fetched coincidence. There was potential-for-romance written all over it.<br><br>But there was a second half to that sentence: The phone rang.<br><br>Tom answered it and for a while after hello, he said nothing. He just listened with a puzzled expression that could mean he'd been snagged either by someone who wanted to steam-clean our carpets or by a very distant cousin whose kid was in jail. Public defenders were modern-day priests in a sense: If someone had done something wrong, they were quick to call Tom and confess. Then he started to say, "Kay? Kay?" and then listened again. He said, "Honey, are you all right? Take a breath. Try to take a breath. Are you all right?"<br><br>Words to make any mother put down her fork and jump to her feet. I gestured for him to give me the phone.<br><br>"Kay?" Tom said. "Do you think you could talk to your mother? I'm going to put your mother on the phone." Tom's voice sounded frightened. He had a better sense of the terrible things that can happen in the world than most people do. "She's crying," he said, holding his hand over the mouthpiece. "I can't tell what she's saying."<br><br>"Kay?" I said. "Kay-bird?"<br><br>From the other end of the line there was a great deal of sobbing and snuffling, and immediately I felt my shoulders drop with relaxation. It was a sobbing and snuffling I knew. I can't explain how. It was as if I came equipped with the secret decoder ring that made me capable of distinguishing the intent of my daughter's cries. Even when she was a baby, I could tell from the other side of the house when she was hungry and when she needed changing and when she just wanted to be picked up and brought along for the ride. I could separate the cries of our three sons, too, but the difference was they stopped crying when they hit a certain age and Kay remained weepy by nature. Even now that she was thirty and a lawyer herself, she would find herself tearing up over an article in the newspaper or a commercial for long-distance service and have to excuse herself for a moment to go into another room and pull it together.<br><br>This crying, the subtle combination of gasping and a low, mucousy rattle that meant she wasn't even taking the time to blow her nose, I knew to be a cry over love. I mouthed the word to Tom, "Dumped." He raised his eyebrows and gave a sage shrug. Although it was a shame to think that such a thing had happened, neither of us was exactly surprised. Portraits of both Trey Bennett's great-grandfather and his great-great-grandfather hung in what they called the library of the country club. I had seen them over the years at wedding receptions and other inescapable social obligations. All the firstborn Bennett sons were named Conrad, though the grandfather was called Sergeant and the father was called, even on the most formal of occasions, Sport, and Trey was called Trey, indicating, one would think, that he was the third when in fact he must have been the sixth or seventh. The Bennett family was exhausting and inescapable in Raleigh, huge and recklessly blessed. They all had perfect teeth and Mercedes SUVs. They flew their own planes to their own summer houses and ski chalets. Their name was chipped into the marble of every hospital, art museum, and social register in the tri-city area. From what I could track in the paper over the years, they tended to marry young and reproduce enthusiastically, so Trey Bennett was a bit of an anomaly, being single at thirty-five. He was considered by everyone, especially his mother, to be the very definition of eligible. What he had been doing dating a thirty-year-old public defender who didn't even know any debutantes, much less been one herself, was a mystery to all of us, and now poor Kay was sobbing, her heart having been skidded across the pavement at top speed yet again.<br><br>"Baby," I said. "Deep breath. Come on now, try to relax."<br><br>Tom sat back down at the table and started to eat the dinner that was already halfway to cold.<br><br>"I-baaa," Kay said. "I-baaa."<br><br>"It's okay," I said. I pointed at my plate and Tom slid it over to me. The pasta was getting stiff, but I managed to force a few pieces into a twirl around my fork.<br><br>I settled in and listened to Kay cry. Sometimes that's all a mother can do. Truth be told, Trey had made me a little uncomfortable. Not that he wasn't nice. He was extraordinarily nice. His manners would have made Cary Grant feel inadequate. But whenever they stopped by our house, I was always aware that a family dog long since dead had peed on our only Oriental rug and left an irregular stain. When Trey was in the house, I wished I hadn't come straight from the dance studio in my leotard and warm-ups. I wished I'd showered. The few times he came to dinner, he complimented everything lavishly, but I was always plagued by images of matching serving utensils and Venetian water glasses. After the third time, Tom and I decided it would be less stressful to take them out.<br><br>"Do you want to come over?" I said to Kay. I looked at Tom, mouthed the word "Sorry."<br><br>He shook his head. "No, no," he mouthed back, and then he made a beckoning gesture with his hand for her to come on over. Tom was a good father.<br><br>On the other end of the line I could hear Kay put down the phone and blow her nose, which was a sign that she was in the first stages of pulling it together. Then she picked up the receiver and inhaled hugely. I didn't make a sound for fear of distracting her. "Married," she said, and then began to cry again.<br><br>"Trey's getting married!" I said. Tom leaned over the table. "I can't believe that. Oh, sweetheart, that's awful. That's too much."<br><br>"Me-e-e-e-e," she wailed. "Marry me!"<br><br>I stopped and cocked my head toward my shoulder as if this might make me hear better. "He married you?" I asked quietly.<br><br>Cry, cry, cry. "Asked," she managed to gasp out. "Asked me."<br><br>I clamped my hand down over the mouthpiece. "Mother of God," I said to Tom. "He's asked her to marry him."<br><br>The blood slipped away from Tom's face. Who knew where it was going. We saw it all in an instant, the way they say you review your life as a milk truck swerves into your lane of traffic. But in this case what flashed before our eyes was the future: anniversary dances at the country club, invitations to sail in the Caribbean, severe pressure to attend fund-raising dinners for senators who opposed school lunches and gun control. The phone rang.<br><br>It was George's phone, what we still referred to as the children's line even though three of our children were grown and gone and George was twenty-five years old, in his first year of law school, and less of a child than Tom or I had ever been. Under normal circumstances we would have let the machine pick up, but these were not normal circumstances. Tom rose, pale as Banquo's ghost, and floated down the hall toward the ringing.<br><br>"Kay," I said sweetly, trying to make my voice that same voice that had soothed her as a baby. "Are you going to marry Trey?" For some reason all I could think about were their names, Kay and Trey, Trey and Kay. Marriage was hard enough without rhyming.<br><br>The crying stopped abruptly and I could hear the scratchy brush of Kay wiping the phone with a Kleenex. "Of course I'm going to marry Trey."<br><br>"Caroline," Tom called from down the hall.<br><br>"One second, baby. Yes?"<br><br>"Minnie, it's your sister on the...</p><h2>Lalique (Shire Collections)</h2><p><p>Rene Lalique was one of the giants of twentieth-century decorative arts. Born in 1860, early artistic talent led to an apprenticeship with Paris goldsmith Louis Aucoc. By 1885, Rene had established his own workshop and for the next twenty years he designed and made jewelry of great originality and beauty. He became famous across the world for his jewelry, but before the turn of the century he began experimenting with glass. It is for his glass that Lalique is most famous today.</p><p>In 1907, Lalique met the perfume manufacturer Francois Coty, and this led to the design and production of fine art perfume bottles on a grand scale. But Lalique's glass would not be confined to ladies' dressing tables, his repertoire including vases, lighting, clocks, car mascots, several architectural commissions and more, much of it in the Art Deco idiom, of which Lalique was one of the masters. Rene Lalique died in 1945, but the firm he founded was continued by his son Marc, and then his daughter Marie-Claude who heads the firm today.</p><p>This highly illustrated history of Lalique celebrates the extraordinary jewelry and glass of Rene Lalique, and the glass of the Lalique company up to the present day.</p></p><p>Eric Knowles began work at Bonhams, the London auctioneers, in 1976 and became head of the ceramics department in 1981.

Dark, evil things live there, suffused with the power of shadow. Some mortals in the natural world learn how to tap into this source. Assassins. Necromancers. Hexblades. By all accounts, a ruthless lot. However, not all beings that draw strength from the Shadowfell are vile, blackhearted fiends.

The South and Three Sectional Crisis, is a commentary on the crises of 1819-1821, 1846-1850, and 1854-1861, shows how the South-especially the lower South-contributed decisively to the sectional conflict that exploded at last into the civil war. Constitutions and Constitutionalism in the Slaveholding South finds that southern state constitutional development generally paralleled that of northern states, but an increasingly distinctive and dangerous southern interpretation of the United States Constitution finally spawned the short-lived wartime Confederate Constitution. The two studies together outline the South&#39;s determination to maintain political power and equality against the northern majority, and explains how this determination led to southern nationalism, disunion, and the Civil War.</p><p>Don E.

To quote the old saying that old people are always saying: &#x201c;Money can&#x2019;t buy happiness.&#x201d;</p><p>How very true that is.</p><p>Oh, you might <i>think</i> money would make you happy. But would it really? Let&#x2019;s say you inherited a billion dollars. You could have a private jet, live in a mansion with a swimming pool, drive a Maserati. You could drive your Maserati into your swimming pool if you felt like it. That&#x2019;s how rich you&#x2019;d be.</p><p>But would all that money really make you happy? Would your family and friends really love you any more?</p><p>OK, they probably would, especially if you let them ride in your jet. And if they <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> love you more, you could afford to have them professionally whacked and get a whole new set of family and friends. People would <i>audition</i> to be your friend. I would be one of these people.</p><p>So apparently the old saying is wrong: Money <i>can</i> buy you happiness. The problem is, you need a really large quantity of it. You have to be one of those twenty-three-year-old Internet billionaires that everybody would like to punch in the mouth.</p><p>So most of us have to seek happiness in other ways. Tragically, some people turn to drugs or alcohol. This is a big mistake. I realize that the title of this book seems to suggest that you can achieve happiness by drinking beer, but that is of course a joke. Beer is not the answer. Sure, when your problems are getting you down, drinking beer might <i>temporarily</i> improve your mood. But what happens when the beer wears off? You&#x2019;re right back where you started, still stuck with all the same problems. Sooner or later, you&#x2019;re going to have to face the harsh truth:<i> You need more beer.</i></p><p>No! Strike that. The harsh truth is that happiness is an elusive thing. I speak from personal experience here. I should be a happy man. I have all the elements of a good life: a loving family, a nice home, a dog that doesn&#x2019;t pee indoors without a good reason. I have a full head of hair and several original teeth. I have no major health issues that I am aware of, thanks to a rigorous healthcare regimen of never getting within 200 yards of a known healthcare provider. I have a small group of really close male friends with whom I am not in touch because we are males, but I know I can count on them if I ever really need them, assuming they are still alive.</p><p>And if all of that isn&#x2019;t enough, I&#x2019;ve had a long and rewarding career that consists of being paid to write pretty much any random idiot thing I want. You can put suspenders on a salamander, but it still won&#x2019;t make waffles. See what I mean? That sentence makes absolutely no sense, but <i>I got paid to write it</i>. It&#x2019;s printed right here in a published book! Unless you&#x2019;re a high-ranking federal official, there is no way you can do anything this useless and still have a job.</p><p>So I have been blessed with many blessings. I should be happy. And I am, sort of. But I can&#x2019;t escape the nagging feeling that I&#x2019;m not <i>really</i> happy, at least not the way I was when I was young and carefree and basically an idiot.</p><p>I especially have this feeling when it&#x2019;s my turn to drive the soccer practice car pool for my daughter, Sophie, and some of her teammates. This involves spending up to an hour in a confined space with a group of fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls, all high school freshmen, listening to them discuss the concerns that girls of that age have, such as racism, bullying and global climate change.</p><p>I am of course kidding. Here are the top ten concerns of my daughter and her friends, based on their car pool conversations:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Boys.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The hideous totally unwarranted cruelty of high school teachers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;What this one boy did in this one class OMG.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Some video on some Internet thing that is HILARIOUS.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Hair.<p>6-10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys.</p><p>All of the girls discuss all of these topics simultaneously at high volume while at the same time (they are excellent multi-taskers) thumbing away on their phones and listening to the radio, which is cranked way up so they can hear it over the noise they&#x2019;re making.</p><p>So they&#x2019;re very loud. They&#x2019;re spooking cattle as far away as Scotland. But here&#x2019;s the thing: It&#x2019;s a <i>happy</i> noise. These girls are the happiest people I know. <i>Everything</i> makes them laugh. They love <i>everything</i>, except the things they hate, and they love hating those things. They literally cannot contain their happiness: It explodes from them constantly in shrieks and shouts, enveloping them in a loud cloud of pure joy. It gets even louder when the radio plays their favorite song&#x2014;which is basically every song&#x2014;and they all sing joyfully along at the top of their lungs. For example, recently, as I was driving them to practice, the girls&#x2014;most of these are good Catholic girls who attend Catholic school, where they receive religious instruction&#x2014;suddenly, in unison, began belting out these lyrics:</p><p><i>My anaconda don&#x2019;t want none unless you GOT BUNS, HON!</i></p><p>This is the chorus to a song called &#x201c;Anaconda,&#x201d; in which a man&#x2014;Sir Mix-a-Lot&#x2014;is declaring his fondness for large buttocks on women. The &#x201c;anaconda&#x201d; refers to one of his body parts. (Hint: Not his pancreas.)</p><p>I know what you&#x2019;re thinking: Why did I let the girls listen to such an inappropriate song? Why didn&#x2019;t I change the station? My excuses are:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;It took me a while to figure out that the song was not about an actual anaconda.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;If I changed the station, odds are that the new station would also be playing &#x201c;Anaconda,&#x201d; or another song that was just as inappropriate. As far as I can tell from driving the car pool, all radio stations play the same two inappropriate songs in heavy rotation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Young people have been listening to inappropriate songs on the radio for centuries, dating back to when I was a young person and we listened to &#x201c;Louie Louie,&#x201d; which everybody knew had dirty words, although nobody knew exactly what they were:<p><i>Louie Louie</i></p><p><i>[Something unintelligible but supposedly obscene]</i></p><p><i>Yi yi yi yi!</i></p><p>But getting back to happiness: I envy my daughter and her friends. I wish I could be as happy as they are, although I wouldn&#x2019;t want to have to go back to high school and deal with acne and the cosine again. I want to be happy AND be a grown-up, if that&#x2019;s possible. But as I say, happiness is elusive.</p><p>Which brings us to this book. It&#x2019;s a group of essays on a variety of topics. They may seem pretty random, but in fact there&#x2019;s an underlying theme, which is happiness. There&#x2019;s an essay about my parents&#x2019; generation, which I believe somehow managed to be happier than mine, which was <i>not</i> supposed to happen. There&#x2019;s a letter to my grandson, imparting wisdom that I hope will enable him to have a happy and fulfilling life, or at least keep him from unnecessarily refrigerating his condiments. There&#x2019;s an essay on whether adopting modern technology&#x2014;specifically Google Glass&#x2014;can bring happiness (SPOILER ALERT: No). There&#x2019;s an essay on the never-ending funfest that is cable TV news, and one on David Beckham, who makes many people happy, but not me. There are reports on my trips to Brazil, which is basically a happy place, and Russia, which might be, but I had no idea what anybody was saying. There&#x2019;s some advice for my daughter as she reaches the age when she can legally drive in Florida, which makes her happy, although it terrifies me. And there&#x2019;s an essay on home ownership, which is the American dream, and a guaranteed way to not achieve happiness.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s the book. I hope you like it. I hope it makes you happy.</p><p>If not, there&#x2019;s always beer.</p><p></p><p></p><p>BITE ME, DAVID BECKHAM</p><p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p><p></p><p></p><p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p><p>I hate David Beckham. To understand why, take a moment to examine the picture below. It&#x2019;s my yearbook photo from my senior year at Pleasantville (N.Y.) High School, where I was a member of the class of 1965:</p><p>This photo has not been retouched. This is what I actually looked like when I was a senior in high school and desperate to be accepted by my peers, or at least not get beaten up by them.</p><p>Perhaps you are thinking: &#x201c;Hey, don&#x2019;t be so hard on yourself! Back then <i>everybody</i> looked like a dweeb!&#x201d;</p><p>I appreciate your thoughtful effort to console me, but no, not everybody did. Many people back then looked normal; some were actually quite attractive. I was not one of them, as you can clearly see. Remember: This was my <i>high school yearbook photo</i>, which means I was actively trying to look good when it was taken. This was <i>the best I could do</i>.</p><p>Part of the problem was simple genetics. I was not a naturally good-looking male. Also I was a late developer puberty-wise. In the photo, I&#x2019;m looking thoughtfully into the distance, as if I&#x2019;m thinking: &#x201c;I wonder what the future holds in store as I prepare to depart from high school and enter the next phase of my life.&#x201d; In fact I am thinking: &#x201c;I wonder if I will ever develop body hair.&#x201d;</p><p>Speaking of which: Note my haircut. I appear to be wearing a malnourished weasel on my head. How did I achieve that look? I&#x2019;ll tell you how: <i>My dad cut my hair.</i> He was a Presbyterian minister. He had received extensive training in theology, but, incredibly, this training did not include a single course in hair design. Also he was bald.</p><p>Nevertheless, for years my dad cut my hair, and my brothers&#x2019; hair, using electric clippers that he bought at a drugstore. In my opinion it is tragic that our elected officials, who are always making such a fuss about assault rifles, make no effort whatsoever to regulate the sale of electric hair clippers to civilians. In a sane world, my dad would never have been allowed to possess those things. He was a thoughtful, wise and kind man, but he had the hairstyling talents of an enraged barn owl. Consider, for example, this sector of my haircut:</p><p>What are we to make of these two strange, vaguely clawlike hair formations on my forehead? It&#x2019;s not at all clear what their role in the hairstyle is. Are they supposed to belong to the majority of my hair, drifting off to the side? Or are they supposed to be pointing down and forming bangs? Apparently they cannot decide! So they&#x2019;re just going to loiter there in the middle of my forehead, looking weird. <i>In my high school yearbook photo.</i> Which is the PERMANENT RECORD OF WHAT I LOOKED LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL.</p><p>Not that I am bitter.</p><p>Now consider my eyeglasses:</p><p>I started wearing glasses in third grade. I was the first kid in my class to need them. I was also one of the smaller kids, which made me the Puny Kid With Glasses, often sensitively referred to by the other kids* as &#x201c;Four-Eyes.&#x201d; My mom took me to get my glasses at the optical department of Macy&#x2019;s in White Plains, N.Y., which offered basically one style of eyeglasses for boys, which should have been called &#x201c;You Will Die a Virgin.&#x201d;</p><p>Today, 1960s-style eyeglass frames are considered &#x201c;retro&#x201d; and are worn ironically by members of the hipster community. Ha-ha! How clever of you, hipsters! Maybe, to complete the &#x201c;look,&#x201d; you can also develop a case of retro 1960s-style acne, causing zits the size of hockey pucks to erupt randomly on your face, especially on those rare occasions when you had the opportunity to talk to an actual girl. Wouldn&#x2019;t that be <i>ironic</i>?!</p><p>Not that I am bitter about that, either.</p><p>Anyway, my point is that in high school I was not physically attractive to the opposite sex, namely girls.</p><p>&#x201c;But Dave,&#x201d; I hear you remarking, &#x201c;looks aren&#x2019;t everything! There are plenty of other qualities besides cuteness that girls look for in boys.&#x201d;</p><p>Good point! And when I say &#x201c;Good point!&#x201d; I mean you are a stupid idiot. The girls of Pleasantville High School were not interested in &#x201c;plenty of other qualities besides cuteness.&#x201d; I know this because I HAD plenty of other qualities besides cuteness. Sarcasm, for example. I had a black belt in sarcasm. I went entire <i>years</i> without ever saying anything that was not basically the opposite of what I actually thought. Also I could make realistic farting sounds with my hands. These are just two of the many qualities other than cuteness I had in high school. None of them impressed girls. You will never hear a high school girl say about a boy, in a dreamy voice, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s <i>so</i> sarcastic!&#x201d;</p><p>Here is an actual thing that happened to me in eleventh grade:</p><p></p></p><h2>Flesh and Blood: A Scarpetta Novel (Kay Scarpetta Series, 22)</h2><p><p>It&#x2019;s Dr. Kay Scarpetta&#x2019;s birthday, and she&#x2019;s about to head to Miami for a vacation with Benton Wesley, her FBI profiler husband, when she notices seven pennies on a wall behind their Cambridge house.

Long before others understood the potential of the personal computer, he saw its true power. But it was his visionary use of media to explain technology to a hungry culture that revealed his singular genius. In Appletopia, media and culture critic Brett T. Robinson reconstructs Steve Jobs&#39; imagination for digital innovation in transcendent terms. From Zen Buddhism and Catholicism to dystopian and futurist thought, religion defined and branded Jobs&#39; design methodology. Robinson resurrects Jobs&#39; uncanny ability to integrate philosophical and religious thought with technological genius, laying the groundwork for Apple&#39;s ubiquity today. As it turns out, culture was eager to find meaning in the burgeoning technological revolution, naming Jobs as its prophet and Apple&#39;s advertising as its gospel.</p><p>Brett T. Robinson is Visiting Professor of Marketing in the Mendoza College of Business, University of Notre Dame, where he also studied marketing and English literature. His doctorate is from the University of Georgia where he helped establish the New Media Institute in the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.

He kicks. He screams. He spits! But then a shepherd calls; she needs a llama to watch over her sheep. She decides to take a chance on Harley. Through the seasons, a series of challenges both great and small turn the temperamental llama into a loving leader&#x2014;whether he's facing mischievous lambs, a bullying ram, or a pack of coyotes who prey on the sheep. With its poetic language and captivating artwork by Caldecott Honor-winning Molly Bang, this distinctive book speaks to all those who sometimes march to the beat of a different drummer.</p><p>Star Livingstone formerly lived in a tipi near the edge of the field where Harley watches his sheep. She now lives in Forestport, New York.Gr. 1-3, younger for reading aloud. In a lively, thoroughly enjoyable debut, Livingstone uses ultrashort sentences and contraction-free prose to both comic and dramatic effect, drawing from personal experience for this tale of a bad-tempered llama brought in to guard a flock of sheep from prowling coyotes. Stubbornly resistant to being trained as a pack animal, Harley becomes a mother hen once transferred to the shepherd's field, eating out of the shepherd's hand, carefully supervising the lambing, and one night springing to the attack when coyotes jump the fence: "Harley is screaming. Harley is running. His legs fly out every which way. His neck waves back and forth . . . .The coyotes are not there. They have run away." Molly Bang's artwork ranges from spot illustrations to full-spread scenes. Bang effectively captures the visual appeal of the woolly sheep and their ungainly, long-necked guardian, leaving large areas of her rough, speckled paper unfinished for a rustic look. The author and illustrator steer clear of anthropomorphism, but their close, accurate, good-humored observations not only bring out the individual characters here, but also will draw readers irresistibly into the world of field and flock as well. Excellent for newer readers wanting practice. <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Then a bomb explodes in a London suburb. <br>&nbsp;<br>The brilliant but politically compromised Inspector Carmichael of Scotland Yard is assigned the case. What he finds leads him to a conspiracy of peers and communists, of staunch King-and- Country patriots and hardened IRA gunmen, to murder Britain's Prime Minister and his new ally, Adolf Hitler. <br>&nbsp;<br>Against a background of increasing domestic espionage and the suppression of Jews and homosexuals, an ad-hoc band of idealists and conservatives blackmail the one person they need to complete their plot, an actress who lives for her art and holds the key to the Fuhrer's death. From the ha'penny seats in the theatre to the ha'pennies that cover dead men's eyes, the conspiracy and the investigation swirl around one another, spinning beyond anyone's control. <br>&nbsp;<br>In this brilliant companion to Farthing, Welsh-born World Fantasy Award winner Jo Walton continues her alternate history of an England that could have been, with a novel that is both an homage of the classic detective novels of the thirties and forties, and an allegory of the world we live in today.</p><p>Jo Walton is the author of several novels including the World Fantasy Award-winning Tooth and Claw.

Like it or not, I&#x2019;m a Larkin. They don&#x2019;t want the headline &#x201c;Peer&#x2019;s Daughter Hanged.&#x201d; So much easier to shut me away and promise that if I keep very quiet they&#x2019;ll release me as cured into my family&#x2019;s custody in a year or two. Well, I may have been an awful fool, but I&#x2019;ve never been saner, and besides, I can&#x2019;t stand most of my family. I&#x2019;ve never had the slightest intention of keeping quiet. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m writing this. I hope someone someday might get the chance to read it. Pay attention. I&#x2019;m going to tell you the important things, in order.<br>It started in the most innocuous way, with a job offer.<br>&#x201c;You are the only woman I can truly imagine as Hamlet, Viola.&#x201d; Antony gazed into my eyes across the table in a way which someone must have told him was soulful and irresistible, but which actually makes him look like a spaniel that needs worming. He was one of London&#x2019;s best-known actor managers, very distinguished, quite fifty years old, and running a little to fat. It was an honor to be given one of Antony&#x2019;s famous lunches, always t�te-�-t�te, always at the Venezia in Bedford Street, and always culminating, after the mouthwatering dessert, in the offer of a leading role.<br>That was the year that everyone was doing theater cross-cast. It was 1949, eight years after the end of the war. London&#x2019;s theaters were brightly lit, and full of the joys and struggles of life. Palmer did it first, the year before, putting on The Duke of Malfi at the Aldwych. Everyone said it would be a fizzle at best, but we all went to see how they did it, out of curiosity. Then, with Charlie Brandin getting raves as the Duke, Sir Marmaduke jumped on the bandwagon and did Barrie&#x2019;s old Quality Street, with all the men as women and all the women men. It was the success of the winter, so when plays were being picked for the summer season, of course there was hardly a house playing things straight.<br>I&#x2019;d scoffed as much as anyone, or more, so much in fact that I&#x2019;d turned down a couple of parts and thought of leaving town and lying low for a little. But if I left, where could I go? London theater was putting up a brave struggle against the cinema, a struggle already lost elsewhere. Theater in the provinces was at its last death rattle. When I was starting out, a London play would be toured all over the country, not by the London cast but by a second-string company. There might be two or three tours of the same play, the second company doing Brighton and Birmingham and Manchester, and the third doing a circuit of Cardiff and Lancaster and Blackpool. The deadliest tours played at every tiny place, crossing the country by train on a Sunday, staying in the most appalling digs. It was the way you started out, and if you were better known and wanted a rest from London, the second companies were panting to snap you up. But since the war tours were rare, and there was fierce competition for them. There was only London, and the occasional tryout elsewhere. People in the provinces could just whistle for theater. They were starved of it entirely. I can&#x2019;t think how they managed. Amateur productions and coming up to London when they could afford it, I suppose. Either that or they really were quite happy with the cinema instead.<br>In any case, there was no hope of a tour for me. If I didn&#x2019;t work, I could afford to lie quiet for a season, if I lived carefully. The problem was that I couldn&#x2019;t count on it being only one season. The theater lives from moment to moment, and once your name isn&#x2019;t seen it can easily be forgotten. I didn&#x2019;t want to leave acting, and besides, what was I supposed to do, starve? Well, the choice would be to starve or go back to my family, which would, I felt sure, be much worse than starving. My family are like cannibals, except that they wear pearls and diamonds instead of necklaces of skulls.<br>I gave Antony one of my best indecisive glances. Indecisive glances would be helpful if I took the part. Hamlet is famously indecisive. Besides, even if my friends did laugh at me for a few days, how often is anyone given the chance to play Hamlet? I&#x2019;d gone along for lunch with Antony knowing it meant a good meal, almost sure I&#x2019;d turn down whatever he offered me. Antony was never stingy, and the wine at the Venezia was always good. Hamlet, though. There are so few truly good women&#x2019;s parts in the world, and Hamlet was a dream of a role, as long as the cross-casting didn&#x2019;t make the whole play absurd. I could picture the lights already: viola lark as hamlet.<br>&#x201c;Will you reverse everyone?&#x201d; I asked, moving a little away from Antony and signaling to the waiter that my plate was utterly empty of tiramisu and could be taken away.<br>Antony took up his wineglass and sipped. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Consider Hamlet, daughter and heir to Denmark. How much more likely that her uncle would usurp? How much more difficult that she assert herself? Hesitation would be much much more natural than for a man. Her relationship with Gertrude, with Claudius, works perfectly. Horatio wishes to be more than a friend. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern can be seen in the light of Penelope&#x2019;s lovers. Laertes, too, Laertes is Hamlet&#x2019;s true love, which makes the end sing. In fact, the whole play makes much more sense this way.&#x201d;<br>He almost convinced me. &#x201c;But Ophelia?&#x201d; I asked, as the waiter glided over and poured more wine. &#x201c;Surely you&#x2019;re not thinking of making that a sapphic relationship?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s funny, there are enough women in the theater who wouldn&#x2019;t look at a man, and men who wouldn&#x2019;t look at a woman for that matter, but everyone would have forty fits if you tried to put a storyline explicitly mentioning them into a play.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no real textual evidence it is a physical relationship at all,&#x201d; Antony said, dreamily. &#x201c;Or one could read whatever one wanted into their earlier relationship, why not, get thee to a nunnery, after all.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But surely Polonius sets her to entice Hamlet?&#x201d; I shook my head, realizing that I&#x2019;d have to look at the text again to make sure exactly what Polonius said. I&#x2019;d never played Ophelia, all I had was a vague impression of the speech. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see a pompous stick like him encouraging a sapphic enticement, or if he did, I can&#x2019;t see the Lord Chamberlain allowing us to show it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The wonderful thing about you, Viola, is that there&#x2019;s something in your head already,&#x201d; Antony said. &#x201c;So many young actresses have no ideas whatsoever. Hmm. We could reverse Ophelia, and make her another suitor; Hamlet beset by suitors. The two brothers, Laertes and Ophelia. That works, my dear. We&#x2019;d have to cut the nunnery line. I don&#x2019;t want to change lines, except for the he/she stuff, obviously, but Hamlet is always cut, judiciously, but cut. At full length, it would play almost four hours.&#x201d;<br>I could imagine a female Hamlet beset by suitors, doubts, and ghosts. She&#x2019;d be virginal, disgusted by her mother&#x2019;s sexuality and unsure of her own. I was feeling my way into the part already. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it,&#x201d; I said, draining my glass.<br>&#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; Antony said, beaming. &#x201c;And with your well-known family background, I don&#x2019;t need to ask if you&#x2019;re British born.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I was born in Ireland, actually,&#x201d; I said, resenting the bit about well-known background. The papers had always made such a meal of my family, it had been a real handicap when I was starting off. I hated thinking people came to see me on the dancing bear principle. &#x201c;Pappa was still Lord Lieutenant there at the time. But I&#x2019;m a British subject.&#x201d;<br>Antony frowned. &#x201c;Do you have a new identity card?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;Of course I do.&#x201d; I fished it out of my bag and dropped it on the table, open. My rather wide-eyed snap looked up at both of us. &#x201c;The Honourable Viola Anne Larkin. Date of Birth: February 4, 1917. Age: 32. Height: 5 feet and 7 inches. Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue. Religion: Church of England. Place of birth: Dublin. Nationality: British. Mother: British. Father: British.&#x201d; I folded it up again. &#x201c;And you could add to that grandmothers and grandfathers back to when one Lord Carnforth married a French countess in 1802, or back to the Conquest on Mother&#x2019;s side.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, it&#x2019;s just that with the new regulations we simply can&#x2019;t employ anyone who isn&#x2019;t really British.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The new regulations are a stupid waste of time,&#x201d; I said, lighting a cigarette.<br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more, my dear, but I have to observe them or I&#x2019;ll be in trouble.&#x201d; Antony sighed. &#x201c;My own mother was American, and in some eyes that makes me suspect.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But the Americans are our cousins across the Atlantic, sort of thing, surely?&#x201d; I said, blowing out smoke.<br>&#x201c;Surely,&#x201d; Antony repeated, cynically. &#x201c;But for some people they&#x2019;ll always be the land of Mrs. Simpson, and President Roosevelt refusing to help us in 1940. I had a certain amount of difficulty with the registration for the new card. It was nonsense, as you say.&#x201d; He drained his glass.<br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t let it upset you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Have you cast anyone else?&#x201d;<br>The waiter, as smooth as a machine, and to tell the truth, as oily, brought us coffee. Antony stirred sugar into his, being a man and not caring about extra inches. He got his mind back to the play, finally.<br>&#x201c;I thought of taking Claudius myself. I imagine Claudius as a man bad enough to commit murder, but with enough conscience to come to feel guilty. Very interesting part. Complex.&#x201d;<br>I tried my coffee. It was excellent. Italians always know how to make good coffee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;d be splendid. And how lovely it would be to work with you again.&#x201d; That was only half soft-soap. He really was a very good actor, when he played the right type, and Claudius could very well be the right type for him. I could remember him smoldering embarrassingly in Byronic parts and was terribly glad he was too old for that now.<br>He smiled, vain like all actors. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve managed to get Lauria Gilmore for Gertrude. She&#x2019;ll really do justice to her.&#x201d;<br>Lauria was a theater workhorse; she&#x2019;d played Gertrude before, along with almost any part you could mention. &#x201c;I played with Lauria in The Importance of Being Earnest,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;She was a glorious Lady Bracknell,&#x201d; Antony said, gazing into the distance. &#x201c;And you were a splendid Gwendolen too,&#x201d; he said, loyally.<br>I&#x2019;d played Cecily, but I couldn&#x2019;t really expect him to remember. It had been eight years ago, the first season after the war, when everyone had been slightly frantic at the Blitz being over and Hitler stopping at the Channel. Nobody had been really sure if the Farthing Peace would hold, or if we&#x2019;d all be plunged into war again at any minute. All the theaters had either run daring revues or frothy comedies striving for wit. We needed laughter as we&#x2019;d come to terms with not being about to be bombed to bits. Wilde&#x2019;s genuine wit had hit just the right note.<br>&#x201c;How about the suitors?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t made any approaches, but I thought perhaps Brandin for Laertes, and Douglas James for Horatio. I hadn&#x2019;t thought about Ophelia at all, at least, I was thinking in terms of a woman. There won&#x2019;t be many women. No&#x2014;I could make the Player King and the whole troupe women, and have the play-within-the-play work something like a ballet.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t seeing me at all.<br>&#x201c;That would be glorious,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How about Mark Tillet for Ophelia? I played with him in Crotchets two years ago, the play was nothing and it didn&#x2019;t run, but I thought he was jolly good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; Antony came back from his reverie. &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mark Tillet?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh no.&#x201d; Antony sighed. &#x201c;Jewish, my dear, and therefore ruin at the moment. I wouldn&#x2019;t even want the word Jew whispered around a play of mine this season, unless it was The Merchant of Venice.&#x201d;<br>I finished my coffee. &#x201c;Mark? Really? I had no idea. He doesn&#x2019;t look Jewish.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You mean he doesn&#x2019;t have a hooked nose and long ringlets and a copy of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion under his arm?&#x201d; Antony laughed without mirth, a stage laugh. &#x201c;A young lady of your background would probably be surprised how many Jews there are in the theater.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Leave my bloody background out of it,&#x201d; I snapped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been treading the boards since 1936. That wasn&#x2019;t what I meant at all.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Antony said, insincerely. &#x201c;Nobody would doubt you know your way around the theater by now.&#x201d; He set down his coffee cup and signaled to the hovering waiter. &#x201c;Well, since I have secured your services as a leading lady, I shall leave you, and attempt to secure the rest of my cast. Rehearsals begin on Monday, ten sharp, in the theater.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t told me which theater, yet,&#x201d; I said, laughing.<br>&#x201c;The Siddons,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Appropriate, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very appropriate,&#x201d; I agreed. There may have been women who had played Hamlet between me and Sarah Siddons, but I couldn&#x2019;t think of any.<br>&#x201c;Oh, and one other thing, now you&#x2019;ve agreed,&#x201d; he said, confidentially, leaning towards me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told Lauria, but nobody else at all, so keep it to yourself until it&#x2019;s announced officially. The first night, which will be Friday, July first, we&#x2019;ll have a very distinguished audience&#x2014;the Prime Minister and Herr Hitler.&#x201d;<br>I wasn&#x2019;t a snob and didn&#x2019;t give two hoots, but it did mean that the play was likely to get lots of attention from the papers. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What a coup for you, Antony!&#x201d;<br>We parted on the pavement outside the Venezia. It was a typical English June day, drizzling in a fine mist, the kind of day my Irish nanny used to describe as &#x201c;soft.&#x201d; I wanted to go home and read the play, though I couldn&#x2019;t really start learning my lines until I had a proper acting copy with Antony&#x2019;s &#x201c;judicious cuts&#x201d; and whatever he/she changes it needed. I started to walk briskly through Covent Garden towards the tube station. I shared a flat behind the British Museum with my dear friend Mollie Gaston and our dresser, Mrs. Tring. Mrs. Tring wasn&#x2019;t really our dresser. She was a dresser, but she wasn&#x2019;t picky, she&#x2019;d dress anyone. She&#x2019;d been my dresser back in the summer of 1941 in The Importance of Being Earnest and in the chaos that London was then, just after the Blitz, had happened to mention that she was looking for somewhere to live. She&#x2019;d been making me comfortable ever since, and the flat, chosen because it was so cheap, had become like a home. Mollie and Mrs. Tring were like family, only better than my own family because less bloody poisonous.<br>People always think that because my father is a lord, I must live off the family wealth. This is total rot. I could, of course, or to be more precise, there was a time when it would have been possible. In 1935, when I was eighteen, my mother wanted me to be a debutante and I wanted to act. I&#x2019;d done her thing for one season, incidentally learning quite a lot in the process, and thereafter I went my own way. She said she&#x2019;d never speak to me again and the family would cut me off with a shilling, and I walked out. Our relations have been rocky ever since. Swearing you&#x2019;ll never speak to someone again is easy, but of course very hard to keep up. But I&#x2019;ve never quite forgotten it, and I never go to Carnforth. My little sister Dodo comes to see me when she&#x2019;s in London, and when she brings her children up we all go to the zoo and I take them out for ices.

Hudson is one of the tiny handful of economic thinkers in today&#39;s world who are forcing us to look at old questions in startling new ways&#34;. Alvin Toffler, best-selling author of Future Shock and The Third Wave This new and completely revised edition of Super Imperialism describes the genesis of America&#39;s political and financial domination. Michael Hudson&#39;s in-depth and highly controversial study of U.S. financial diplomacy explores the faults built into the core of the World Bank and the IMF at their inception which -- he argues -- were intended to preserve the US&#39;s financial hegemony. Difficult to detect at the time, these problems have since become explicit as the failure of the international economic system has become apparent; the IMF and World Bank were set up to give aid to developing countries, but instead many of the world&#39;s poorest countries have been plunged into insurmountable debt crises. Hudson&#39;s critique of the destructive course of the international economic system provides important insights into the real motivations at the heart of these institutions - and the increasing tide of opposition that they face around the world.</p><p>&#34;Michael Hudson&#39;s brilliant shattering book will leave orthodox economists spluttering.

Waldman also conveys the senselessness of centuries of political strife that has formed layer upon layer of abandoned architecture, leaving in its wake destruction and hatred between Israel and some of its neighbors. Although it is brief, the text carefully explains why Jerusalem is so important to Jews, Christians, and Moslems by detailing its occupation over the centuries, with just enough information to satisfy youngsters with little or no historical background. The narrative is further elucidated by full-page colored-pencil drawings on watercolor backgrounds that show views of the city at various times in its history.

Aree's parents shower their daughter with brilliant silk dresses and lovely jewels. A dance held in a nearby village offers Aree a chance to display her sumptuous wardrobe. Determined to be the most beautiful girl there, she cannot decide upon one dress or one jewel, so she ends up wearing all of them. She is so weighed down with layers of finery that she cannot keep up with her friends as they walk over the hill to the dance. When they suggest that she remove some garments, she accuses them of jealousy. In a version collected in Thailand by Kermit Krueger and retold in his collection The Serpent Prince (World, 1969; o.p.), the vain, foolish girl dies of exhaustion. MacDonald's version allows her to learn her lesson and live to practice voluntary simplicity. The story is told in rhythmic, cadenced sentences, ideal for reading aloud. The illustrations substitute modern rural Thailand for the archaic setting of the original tale and depict the characters as somewhat stylized figures dressed in brightly colored Thai silks. An author's note acknowledges Krueger's retelling, puts the tale in cultural context, and suggests strategies for telling it. The text is printed in Thai at the bottom of each page. Art and narrative create an appealing blend of ancient and contemporary wisdom.AMargaret A.

But when Norsemen from across the sea burn his village, Osric is taken prisoner by these warriors. Their chief, Sigurd the Lucky, believes the Norns have woven this strange boy&#x2019;s fate together with his own, and Osric begins to sense glorious purpose among this fellowship of warriors. <br><br>Immersed in the Norsemen&#x2019;s world and driven by their lust for adventure, Osric proves a natural warrior and forges a blood bond with Sigurd, who renames him Raven. But the Norsemen&#x2019;s world is a savage one, where loyalty is often repaid in blood and where a young man must become a killer in order to survive. When the Fellowship faces annihilation from ealdorman Ealdred of Wessex, Raven chooses a bloody and dangerous path, accepting the mission of raiding deep into hostile lands to steal a holy book from Coenwolf, King of Mercia. <br>There he will find much more than the Holy Gospels of St Jerome.

The lean days of fasting and the long months of winter had been forgotten with the full bellies of the Easter feast. The people were busy with the outdoor tasks that the icy winds had kept them from: straightening loose thatch, replacing rotten fences, replenishing wood stores, and stirring new life into the rich soil of the plow fields. Wild garlic smothered the earth in the shady woods like a white pelt, its scent whipped up by the breeze, and blue spring squill sat like a low mist upon the grassy slopes and headlands, stirred by the salty sea air.<br><br>Usually I was woken by Ealhstan&#x2019;s mutterings and one of his bony fingers digging into my ribs, but on this day I rose before the old man, hoping to be away catching a fish for our breakfast before having to suffer his ill temper. I even imagined he might be pleased with me for being at the task before the sun reddened the eastern horizon, though it was more likely he would begrudge my being awake before him. Fishing rod in hand and wrapped in a threadbare cloak, I stepped out into the predawn stillness and shivered with a yawn that brought water to my eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;The old goat got you working by the light of the stars now, has he?&#x201d; came a low voice, and I turned to make out Griffin the warrior leading his great gray hunting dog by a rope that was knotted so that the animal choked itself as it fought him. &#x201c;Keep still, boy!&#x201d; Griffin growled, yanking the rope viciously. The beast was coughing, and I thought Griffin might break its neck if it did not stop pulling.<br><br>&#x201c;You know Ealhstan,&#x201d; I said, holding back my hair and leaning over the rain barrel. &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t take a piss before he&#x2019;s had his breakfast.&#x201d; I thrust my face into the dark, cold water and held it there, then came up and shook my head, wiping my eyes on the back of my arm.<br><br>Griffin looked down at the dog, which was beaten at last and stood with its head slumped low between its shoulders, looking up at its master pathetically. &#x201c;Found the dumb bastard sniffing around Siward&#x2019;s place just now. He ran off yesterday. First time I&#x2019;ve laid eyes on him since.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Siward&#x2019;s got a bitch in heat,&#x201d; I said, tying back my hair.<br><br>&#x201c;So the wife tells me,&#x201d; Griffin said, a smile touching his mouth. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t blame him, I suppose. We all want a bit of what&#x2019;s good for us, hey, boy?&#x201d; he added, rubbing the dog&#x2019;s head roughly. I liked Griffin. He was a hard man but had no hatred in him like the others. Or perhaps it was fear he lacked.<br><br>&#x201c;Some things in life are certain, Griffin,&#x201d; I said, returning his smile. &#x201c;Dogs will chase bitches, and Ealhstan will eat mackerel every morning till his old teeth fall out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;d better dip that line, lad,&#x201d; he warned, nodding southward toward the sea. &#x201c;Even Arsebiter here has less bite than old Ealhstan. I wouldn&#x2019;t get on the wrong side of that tongueless bastard for every mackerel the Lord Jesus and His disciples pulled out of the Red Sea.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked back to the house. &#x201c;Ealhstan doesn&#x2019;t have a right side,&#x201d; I said in a low voice. Griffin grinned, bending to rub Arsebiter&#x2019;s muzzle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring you a codfish one of these days, Griffin. Long as your arm,&#x201d; I said, shivering again, and then we parted ways, he toward his house and me toward the low sound of the sea.<br><br>A pinkish glow lay across the eastern horizon, but the sun was still concealed and it was dark as I climbed the hill that shielded Abbotsend from the worst of the weather blowing in from the gray sea. But I had walked the path many times and had no need of a flame. Besides, the old crumbling watchtower stood visible at the hilltop as a black shape against a dark purple sky. Folk said it was built by the Romans, that long-�disappeared race. I did not know if that was true, but I whispered thanks to them anyway, for with the tower in sight I could not lose my way.<br><br>My mind wandered, though, as I considered taking a skiff beyond the sea-�battered rocks the next morning to try to catch something other than mackerel. You could pull in a great codfish if you could get your hook to the seabed. Suddenly, a metallic tock stopped me dead and something whipped my eyes, for an instant blinding me. I dropped to one knee, feeling the hairs spring up on the back of my neck. A guttural croak broke the stillness, and I saw a black shape swoop up, then plunge, settling on the tower&#x2019;s crumbling crown. It croaked again, and even in the weak dawn light its wings glinted with a purple sheen as its stout beak stabbed at its feathers. I had seen similar birds many times&#x2014;�clouds of crows that swept down to the fields to dig for seeds or worms&#x2014;�but this was a huge raven, and the sight of it was enough to freeze my blood.<br><br>&#x201c;Away with you, bird,&#x201d; I said, picking up a small piece of red brick and throwing it at the creature. I missed, but it was enough to send the raven flapping noisily into the sky, a black smear against the lightening heavens. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re scared of birds now, Osric?&#x201d; I muttered, shaking my head as I crested the hill and made my way through stalks of pink thrift and cushioning sea campion down to the shore. A damp mist had been thrown up to blanket the dunes and shingle, and a flock of screeching gulls passed overhead, tumbling down into the murk, leaving behind them a wake of noise. I jumped across three rock pools full of green weed, the small bladders floating at the surface, then onto my fishing rock, where I knocked a limpet into the sea with the butt of my rod before unwinding the line.<br><br>After the time it takes to put a keen edge on a knife, nothing had taken the hook, and I thought about �trying another spot where I had once pulled in a rough-�skinned fish as long as my leg with wicked, sharp teeth. It was then that I caught a strange sound amid the rhythmic breathing of the surf. I wedged the rod in a crevice, the line still in the sea, and scrambled higher up the rocks above the shingle. But I saw nothing other than the sea-�stirred vapor, which seemed alive, like some strange beast writhing before me, concealing and revealing the ocean time and again. I heard only the shrieks of white gulls and the breaking waves and was about to jump down when I heard the strange sound again.<br><br>This time I froze like an icicle. My muscles gripped my bones rigid. The breath caught fast in my chest, and cold fear crept up my spine, prickling my scalp. The thin hollow note of a horn sounded again, and then came the rhythmic slap of oars. As if conjured from the spirit world, a dragon emerged, a wooden beast with a belly of clinkered strakes that flowed up into its slender neck. The monster&#x2019;s head was set with faded red eyes, and I wanted to run but was stuck to the rock like the limpets, fixed by the stare of a great bearded warrior who stood with one arm around the monster&#x2019;s neck. His beard parted, revealing a malicious smile, then the boat&#x2019;s keel scraped up the shingle with a noise like thunder, and men were jumping from the ship, sliding on the wet rocks and falling and splashing into the surf. Guttural voices echoed off the rocks behind me, and my bowels melted. Another dragon ship must have beached farther down the shore beyond Hermit&#x2019;s Rock. Men with swords and axes and round painted shields stepped from the mist, their war gear clinking noisily to shatter the �unnatural stillness. They gathered around me like wolves, pointing east and west, their hard voices rousing shrieks from gulls overhead. I mumbled a prayer to Christ and His saints that my death would be quick as the warrior from the ship&#x2019;s prow stepped up and grabbed my throat. He shoved me at another heathen, who gripped my shoulder with a powerful hand. This one wore a green cloak fastened with a silver brooch in the shape of a wolf&#x2019;s head. I saw the iron rings of a mail shirt, a brynja, beneath the cloak, and I retched.<br><br>Now, after all these years, I might essay a few untruths. I doubt any still live who could prove my words false. I could say that I stuck out my chest and took a grip on my fear. That I did not piss myself. But who would believe me? These outlanders leaping from their dragons were armed and fierce. They were warriors and grown men. And I was just a boy. A strange and frightening magic fell across me then. The outlanders&#x2019; sharp language began to change, seemed to melt, the percussive clipped grunts becoming a stream of sounds that were somehow familiar. I swallowed some of the fear, my tongue beginning to move over those noises like water over pebbles, awakening to them, and I heard myself repeating them until they became no longer just noises but words. And I understood them.<br><br>&#x201c;But look at his eye, Uncle!&#x201d; the man with the wolf brooch said. &#x201c;He is marked. �din god of war has given him a clot of blood for an eye. On my oath, I feel the All-�Father breathing down my neck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I agree with Sigurd,&#x201d; another said, his eyes slits of suspicion. &#x201c;The way he appeared in the mist was not natural. You all saw it. The vapor became flesh! Any normal man would have run from her.&#x201d; He pointed to the ship with its carved dragon&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;But this one stood here as if he was . . . as if he was waiting for us. I want no part in his death, Sigurd,&#x201d; he finished, shaking his head.<br><br>I prayed they would not see the fishing rod in the crack in the rock, and I hoped the mackerel were still asleep, for mackerel fight like devils and if one took my hook, the line would jump and the heathens would see me for what I was.<br><br>&#x201c;I can help you,&#x201d; I spluttered, buoyed suddenly by the hope that the outlanders were lost, blown off course on the way to who knew where.</p><h2>The Short, Strange Life of Herschel Grynszpan: A Boy Avenger, a Nazi Diplomat, and a Murder in Paris</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Washington Post</em> Notable Non-Fiction of 2013<br><br> On the seventy-fifth anniversary of Kristallnacht comes this untold story of a teenager whose act of defiance would have dire international consequences.</strong></p> On the morning of November 7, 1938, a seventeen-year-old Jewish refugee, Herschel Grynszpan, walked into the German embassy in Paris and in an act of desperation assassinated Ernst vom Rath, a low-level Nazi diplomat. He did it, he said, out &#x201c;of love for my parents and for my people.&#x201d; Two days later, vom Rath lay dead, and the Third Reich exploited his murder to inaugurate&nbsp;its long-planned campaign of terror against Germany&#x2019;s Jewish citizens, in the mass pogrom that became known as Kristallnacht. In a bizarre concatenation of events that would rapidly involve Ribbentrop, Goebbels, and Hitler himself, Grynszpan would become the centerpiece of a Nazi propaganda campaign that would later describe his actions as "the first shot of the Jewish War." <p>In <em>The Short, Strange Life of Herschel Grynszpan</em>, best-selling author Jonathan Kirsch brings to light this wrenching story, reexamining the historical details and moral dimensions of one of&nbsp;the most enigmatic cases of World War&nbsp;II. Was Grynszpan a&nbsp;crazed lone gunman, or was he an agent of the Gestapo, recruited to provide a convenient pretext for a major escalation of Nazi aggression? Was he motivated by a desire to strike a blow for the Jewish people as an early partisan fighter, or did his act of violence speak to an intimate connection between the assassin and his target, as Grynszpan later claimed?</p><p>In re-creating the life of this German-Polish refugee turned assassin, Kirsch convincingly demonstrates that the life of Herschel Grynszpan remains just as fascinating as the conspiracy theories that surround him. Challenging the perception of the European Jew as docile and unwilling to resort to violence in the face of aggression, Grynszpan was almost unanimously assailed by most German Jews, who were rightly fearful that the Nazis would use&nbsp;the murder to wreak widespread retribution. Yet he was at the same time embraced by the American journalist Dorothy Thompson, who rallied others to his international defense. Condemned by the likes of Goebbels at the time, he was still labeled as a "psychopath" and an agent provacateur by Hannah Arendt at the Eichmann trial two decades later.</p><p>As Kristallnacht increasingly becomes known as an international day for remembrance, Jonathan Kirsch brilliantly succeeds here in illuminating&nbsp;both a single life cast into the shadows of history as well as the "countless tragic lives of Eastern European Jews in the terrible days leading up to World War II."</p> 8 pages of photographs</p><p>Jonathan Kirsch is the author of the best-selling The Harlot by the Side of the Road and A History of the End of the World, the book editor of the Jewish Journal, and a longtime contributor of book reviews to the Los Angeles Times.

Some have eulogized, some have reinterpreted--but all have respected the work of that great and germinal mind. For thirty years John Dewey has been the most dynamic, arresting figure in American thought. Whereas the "traditional" philosopher too often concerned himself with matters seemingly remote and formalistic, Dewey was ever aware of the ferment of this developing democracy. The problems of every-day life, the "commonplace" in our culture, the direction of the educative process in the schools, the processes of politics, art, literature, science, religion--on all these John Dewey has left the impress of his thought. <br><br>It was inevitable that Dewey's writings should raise questions and doubts, that readers should find points of difference and emphasis.

Or Ray Bradbury's classic <i>The Halloween Tree</i>. Eight boys set out on a Halloween night and are led into the depths of the past by a tall, mysterious character named Moundshroud. They ride on a black wind to autumn scenes in distant lands and times, where they witness other ways of celebrating this holiday about the dark time of year. Bradbury's lyrical prose whooshes along with the pell-mell rhythms of children running at night, screaming and laughing, and the reader is carried along by its sheer exuberance. <p> Bradbury's stories about children are always attended by dread--of change, adulthood, death. <i>The Halloween Tree</i>, while sweeter than his adult literature, is also touched at moments by the cold specter of loss--which is only fitting, of course, for a holiday in honor of the waning of the sun. </p><p> This is a superb book for adults to read to children, a way to teach them, quite painlessly, about customs and imagery related to Halloween from ancient Egypt, Mediterranean cultures, Celtic Druidism, Mexico, and even a cathedral in Paris. (One caveat, though: Bradbury unfortunately perpetuates a couple of misconceptions about <i>Samhain</i>, or summer's end, the Halloween of ancient Celts and contemporary pagans.)

On the ground, the men of Captain Lampard&#39;s SAS patrol spy on German aircraft.</p><p>Derek Robinson, the son of a policeman, read history at Cambridge before working in advertising in London and New York. His novel Goshawk Squadron was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1971.<i>A Good Clean Fight</i> focuses on the British campaign against Rommel in 1942, in particular on one light-armored company's deep reconnaissance of and raids on isolated German airfields--led by the rather daft Jack Lampard--and on Major Paul Schramm, a German intelligence officer, who cleverly tracks the company. We are also introduced to some air squadrons from both sides and their marvelous dogfights. In one tactile scene, a pilot rolls his craft and banks sharply to avoid flak; he "browns out" and then finds himself far over the desert, momentarily quite lost. Nonetheless, Schramm and Lampard steal the show, chasing each other, cracking jokes--they are really quite alike, and, seen through their eyes, war is a grim but also a joyous affair. Even the plague of flies that follows these sweating men every step of the way can seem amusing: "If they followed Lampard rather more faithfully it was not because he was the officer but because he was six foot two and there was more of him to overheat." Robinson is extremely funny, actually, and subtle, which lifts his writing out of the genre; even so, he's not much interested in causes or in the meaninglessness of war. Of course it's meaningless, he might say. He wants to focus on young men in a great adventure, risking their lives and loving it, playing deadly games with complicated, deadly machinery. "Men are always killing themselves to prove their manhood," says a woman at Paul Schramm's funeral.

Anyone who cares about journalism, about important national issues and the way the media addresses them, must read this book.<p> It has been said that Friendly and Edward R. Murrow invented television journalism; certainly their program <i>See It Now</i> set a standard for journalistic courage and principle that in many ways has rarely been equaled. After it was replaced by quiz shows that earned higher ratings, Friendly went on to produce other important news programming and, ultimately, became president of CBS News. He resigned in 1966 in protest when the network decided to run <i>I Love Lucy</i> reruns rather than Senate hearings on Vietnam, calling that decision "the most important act of my life." </p><p> The book closes with an impassioned plea for the creation of a commercial-free public television network that would be free from such pressures; Friendly was later involved in PBS public affairs programming. What he understood is that the use of the public airwaves is a privilege, not a right, and that it comes with serious responsibilities. As he wrote, "Each time that the FCC grants a radio or television license, those to whom it is awarded walk out with a medallion symbolizing service to all the people their station can reach ... commercial television has the resources and professional talent to do all the things that television should be doing, but because of its stockholders, it does not feel that it can often afford to appeal to excellence." The issues that concerned him are still crucial to television journalism today.</p><p> (The 1999 paperback edition includes a new foreword from Dan Rather, who worked for Friendly at CBS, and Tom Bettag, the executive producer of <i>Nightline</i> and a student of Friendly's at Columbia University.) <i>--Linda Killian</i></p>iendly's powerful examination of broadcast news was published in 1967, it was judged by The New Yorker to be "an engrossing professional memoir." and it quickly leaped onto The New York Times bestseller list. Now reissued with a new Introduction by Dan Rather, anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News, and Tom Bettag, executive producer of Nightline, on the anniversary of Friendly's death, this discourse on the importance of television in society presents Friendly's uncannily prescient views on the corrosive effect of money on the news business, the sensationalization of news reporting, and the viewing public's appetite for quality broadcasting. <br>With Edward R. Murrow, Fred Friendly practically invented television journalism. Through telling anecdotes and penetrating analysis, he recalls his collaborations with Murrow, from their stinging documentary on Senator Joseph McCarthy to CBS's pioneering coverage of the burgeoning civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements.

Instead, she undertook extensive investigation into natural remedies and schools of alternative medicine and devised an eclectic home protocol of fasting and nutritional healing. The result: the arthritis disappeared completely, leaving her feeling better than she had in years.<br><br>In <b>Healing Joint Pain Naturally</b>, Brown shares what she's learned in her journey to renewed wellness, in the process proving that the course of arthritis can be reversed. She first investigates the causes of joint disease, examining the roles of stress, poor nutrition, and energy blockage. She then covers the therapeutic possibilities of altered diet and detoxification; supplementation therapies of natural substances that offer safer pain relief without long-term side effects and that promote healing; and regulation therapies, ranging from exercise, massage, and chiropractic to chelation, homeopathy, and acupuncture. Her belief throughout is that healing is a natural process that can be promoted more by respecting the wisdom of the body than by waging war. Inspiring, wide-ranging, eclectic, Healing Joint Pain Naturally brings a message of hope and bodily renewal to millions who have resigned themselves to a life of pain.</p><p>Ellen Hodgson Brown is a health writer who specializes in alternative medicine.

In 1998, the number of afflicted in the United States hit a staggering 43 million&#x2014;15 percent of the population&#x2014;up from 35 million in 1985, in part because the population in general is growing older. The market for analgesic painkillers is even more staggering, amounting to about $10 billion annually.1<br><br>Sales of Searle's arthritis drug Celebrex rivaled the blockbuster Viagra when it hit the market in early 1999. But the success of this "super aspirin" seems to reflect the widespread desperation of arthritis victims more than the viability of the treatment. Celebrex (discussed later in this chapter) is no more effective than older, cheaper options in reversing joint dysfunction. Its claim to fame is that it suppresses pain with fewer daunting side effects than the older drugs. Conventional medicine still has no safe and proven protocol for reversing arthritis.<br><br>DEFINING THE DISEASE<br><br>The word arthritis is derived from the Greek arthron for joint and -itis for inflammation. It thus means inflammation of the joint. Inflammation causes swelling, which causes pain by pressing on the nerves. Joint dysfunction that does not involve inflammation is technically called "arthrosis," meaning simply joint disease.<br><br>The most common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis, a chronic degenerative disease that is epidemic among the elderly. It afflicts about 21 million people in the United States. According to the Arthritis Foundation, the second leading arthritis-related condition is fibromyalgia, a form of muscular rheumatism that involves joint pain and is believed to afflict 3 to 6 million people. The third most frequent arthritic condition is rheumatoid arthritis, the most intractable and painful form of the disease. It afflicts 2.5 million people.2 Fourth is gout, a gene-linked condition in which excess uric acid accumulates and forms crystals that irritate the joints. Other common forms of arthritis include bursitis, a painful inflammation of the bursae (the fluid-filled sacs that cushion the bones, tendons, and ligaments where they move against each other); and ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammation of the spine and hip joints. Many other conditions also involve an element of inflammatory arthritis, including systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE, a chronic inflammatory disease that strikes connective tissue throughout the body.<br><br>THE MECHANICS OF THE DISEASE<br><br>Different forms of arthritis have unique features that are discussed in later chapters. All, however, involve a breakdown of joint cartilage faster than the body can repair it. The joint is where the bones meet and are cushioned so they can move without irritating each other. The joint is protected by a capsule consisting of tough fibrous tissue. It covers the synovial membrane, which surrounds the joint and provides a lubricating fluid. Joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage that allows for easy sliding and absorbs shock. Arthritis strikes this cartilage, causing it to become swollen, flake, and crack.<br><br>When this occurs the body tries to protect itself by layering down extra calcium at the ends of the bone, forming bony spurs inside the joint. These are the bony knobs called Heberden's nodes visible at the ends of the fingers of some arthritis victims. If the node breaks off, it can form a "joint mouse" that moves in the joint space. A joint mouse that has gotten caught between the moving bones can cause serious pain. Friction between the bones also causes heat to build, but the narrowing of the synovial membrane makes blood flow insufficient to carry the heat away. When the joint isn't moving, the synovial membrane gets stiff, leading to "gelling" that makes it even more difficult to move.3<br><br>THE PHARMACEUTICAL APPROACH: NSAIDs<br><br>The conventional approach to the treatment of arthritis is to suppress joint pain with drugs. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) relieve pain by blocking the inflammatory process, but this approach comes with a price. A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that more than 100,000 deaths now occur annually from legal drugs prescribed and used correctly. That makes pharmaceutical side effects the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, following only heart disease, cancer, and stroke.4 And ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding caused by NSAIDs are the most common serious adverse reactions of any drugs on the American market. This side effect has become so common and well known that the complex has its own name: "NSAID gastropathy." A recent Stanford study attributed 107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths yearly to NSAIDs. Taking them increases your likelihood of being hospitalized for gastrointestinal afflictions by a factor of more than six.5<br><br>People who take an occasional aspirin for a headache aren't at great risk. The problems come for people who take the drugs daily in relatively high doses over a period of years. Fourteen million arthritics now fall in that category. NSAIDs were developed specifically to treat rheumatoid arthritis, a crippling form of the disease for which side effect risks may be justified; but NSAIDs are now also frequently prescribed for osteoarthritis, a much larger market with a correspondingly greater potential for drug casualties.<br><br>ASPIRIN<br><br>Aspirin, the grandfather of anti-inflammatories, has long been the most popular treatment for arthritis. Americans collectively pop more than 80 million aspirin tablets daily. Critics question whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would allow this drug on the over-the-counter market if it were introduced today because of its potentially serious side effects; but it has been around in pill form since 1899 (longer than the FDA itself) and was grandfathered in without testing.<br><br>How aspirin works wasn't discovered until more than seventy years after it appeared on the market. The mechanism involves natural substances called prostaglandins, which are released when cells are injured or stimulated. One type, called PGE2, alerts the body to disturbances in normal function by increasing the awareness of pain. Other prostaglandins contribute to the heat and swelling of inflammation and promote the coagulation of blood. Aspirin interferes with the body's biosynthesis of these prostaglandins, thereby suppressing inflammation and the awareness of pain.<br><br>The problem is that prostaglandins perform normal body functions that are suppressed along with the inflammatory process. Some prostaglandins help to regulate the flow of blood through the kidneys and the filtration and excretion of sodium and toxins. When aspirin inhibits these functions, the result can be fluid retention and the buildup of nitrogenous wastes in the blood.6 Other prostaglandins have a direct action on stomach cells. They inhibit acid production and prevent acid damage to the lining of the stomach. When these prostaglandins are suppressed, acid can eat holes in the stomach and intestines. This unwanted side effect is the largest single cause of disease and death due to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Aspirin also causes an excretion of vitamin C in the urine that is three times normal; it can cause iron deficiency from blood loss from irritation of the intestinal lining; it prevents blood from clotting; and it blocks the effects of interferon, one of the substances by which the immune system fights off infections and other ills.7<br><br>NON-ASPIRIN NSAIDs<br><br>Non-aspirin NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), indomethacin (Indocin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and piroxicam (Feldene), among other popular options. The non-aspirin NSAIDs were originally thought to have an advantage over aspirin in that they were better tolerated and produced less gastrointestinal distress. But the FDA eventually proclaimed that the safety of one NSAID could not be clearly distinguished from another.8<br><br>All NSAIDs, including aspirin, inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins.9 NSAIDs can also provoke asthma in some people. A British study found that people over sixty who took non-aspirin NSAIDs were three times as likely as nonusers to be hospitalized with bleeding gastric and duodenal ulcers.10 In another study, elderly people who took ibuprofen regularly were found to be four times as likely to die from ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding as those not taking it.11<br><br>Concerns about the side effects of NSAIDs have led the FDA to require new labels that state in part: "Serious gastrointestinal toxicity such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated chronically with NSAID therapy." All of the currently available NSAIDs are now thought to have roughly equivalent pain-relieving effects, and all are known to cause stomach damage.12<br><br>Acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brands) is an over-the-counter analgesic that is easier on the stomach than NSAIDs; but it doesn't qualify as an anti-inflammatory, because it doesn't reduce inflammation. It therefore isn't much help for arthritics; and while it is easier on the stomach than NSAIDs, it still isn't safe taken over long periods, since it can cause fatal damage to the liver.13<br><br>ANTACIDS AND ACID-BLOCKERS<br><br>As many as 25 percent of people taking NSAIDs at any given time have evidence of ulcers detectable by clinical testing, but most of these ulcers have no symptoms and will heal on their own. The danger comes when an ulcer forms near a blood vessel or grows too large. It can then cause severe pain and other serious complications. Since in its early stages the ulcer goes unnoticed, a serious stomach bleed can come on suddenly, often requiring transfusions and surgery.14<br><br>Many arthritics try to avoid this result by taking antacids or acid-blockers (Tagamet, Zantac, Pepcid AC) preventatively. But a Stanford study reported in 1996 found that this could do more harm than good. The first symptom of an ulcer is usually heartburn. By masking heartburn symptoms, the drugs allow ulcers to get much larger before they are detected. People taking acid-blockers were found to be more than twice as likely to be hospitalized for gastrointestinal complications as those not taking them.15 Acid-blockers also come with their own list of side effects, and one of them is joint and muscle pain. Again, they result largely because the drugs block natural processes.16<br><br>Stomach acid has beneficial functions, one of which is to kill bacteria in the stomach. Without the acid, you run the risk of infection by salmonella and other undesirables. Because acidblockers don't cure ulcers but only mask symptoms, they have to be taken for life by ulcer patients. They have been called "annuity medicines" for drug companies, since they can cost several dollars a day.<br><br>COX-2 INHIBITORS<br><br>In an effort to circumvent the ulcer problem, drug manufacturers developed the Cox-2 inhibitors. These are "super aspirins" that block the Cox-2 enzyme that drives inflammation but don't block the Cox-1 enzyme that releases the prostaglandins protecting the stomach. The drugs don't suppress pain or reverse the ravages of the disease any better than older options, but they have fewer side effects than other arthritis drugs.17<br><br>At least, that is the claim of their manufacturers. The FDA is not convinced. It approved Searle's Cox-2 inhibitor Celebrex as a good option to relieve arthritis pain but declared there is no proof the drug is easier on patients' stomachs than other drugs. The FDA has required the same warning about side effects as for older painkillers.18 Potential downsides of Celebrex reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences include a reduction in beneficial prostaglandins and an increase in the risk of heart attack.19<br><br>Despite these drawbacks, in its first three weeks on the market in early 1999 about 142,000 prescriptions were written for Celebrex, making it the second-fastest-selling new drug after the anti-impotence drug Viagra. Over the long run, in fact, Celebrex is expected to fare better than Viagra, since most users take anti-impotence drugs only when the urge strikes them (or when they hope it will). Arthritis victims take arthritis drugs virtually every day; and once they start on one, they are likely to take it for life. In 1998, drug companies sold about $6 billion in brand-name prescription NSAIDs. Sales of Celebrex were projected to reach $1 billion a year later, equivalent to a sixth of the NSAID market.20 Celebrex costs $2.50 to $3.00 per day for the lowest effective dose (200 mg). This is more than three times the cost of a therapeutically equivalent amount of NSAIDs (ibuprofen or naproxen); while glucosamine and chondroitin sulfates, the most popular nutritional remedies, may be had for as little as twenty cents a day.<br><br>Merck, the world's largest drug company, sought government approval for its own Cox-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, in the spring of 1999. Merck hoped to persuade the FDA that Vioxx is superior to Celebrex and does not need any warning label about gastrointestinal effects.21 But as with Celebrex, the FDA has not permitted Merck to claim that Vioxx is less damaging to the gastrointestinal tract than traditional NSAIDs such as aspirin. The reviewing committee approved the drug for short-term use but observed that its side effects, including swelling, high blood pressure, and elevated potassium levels, increase with increasing doses, suggesting it might not be safe for use long term. The committee advised against its use for chronic pain and said its use for acute pain should be limited to five days, the longest Merck had studied it for that purpose.22<br><br>If the FDA is heeded, Vioxx won't be much help for arthritis sufferers, since they need long-term relief; but the FDA's warnings probably won't halt its use for arthritis pain. The rule is that once a drug has been approved, a doctor may prescribe it for any purpose deemed in his or her professional judgment to be appropriate. Celebrex, its competitor Cox-2 inhibitor, became the number one prescription arthritis medication a year after it got FDA approval.<br><br>THE UNDER-APPRECIATED BENEFITS OF INFLAMMATION<br><br>Even if the Cox-2 inhibitors are not hazardous to the stomach (a matter that remains in dispute), there is a more fundamental problem with these drugs. All arthritis drugs, including Cox-2 inhibitors, relieve the pain of arthritis merely by suppressing some stage of the inflammatory process, thus relieving pressure on the nerves. They do this by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins that cause dilation of the blood vessels. The problem is that this dilation is necessary to increase the blood flow required for the repair of joint structures.<br><br>Studies have shown that suppressing inflammation not only doesn't cure arthritis but actually speeds joint deterioration. Inflammation is a natural process by which the body tries to remove dead or damaged tissue cells and lays down the matrix for new cells to replace the old. It does this by a buildup of body fluids that serves to destroy or wall off toxins and injured tissue and carry immune system cells to the site of damage. When this process is interfered with, the already compromised joint simply deteriorates more rapidly.

Reprint.</p><p>"We look forward to the next three books of this epic." --<i>Realms of Fantasy</i>Janny Wurts is the author of eleven novels, a collection of short stories, and the internationally best selling Empire trilogy written in collaboration with Raymond E. Feist. Her current release in her Wars of Light and Shadow series, Grand Conspiracy, and her forthcoming hardcover, Peril's Gate, are the culmination of more than twenty years of carefully evolved ideas. The cover images on the books, both in the US and abroad, are her own paintings, depicting her vision of characters and setting.<p>Through her combined talents as a writer/illustrator, Janny has immersed herself in a lifelong ambition: to create a seamless interface between words and pictures that will lead reader and viewer beyond the world we know. Her lavish use of language lures the mind into a crafted realm of experience, with characters and events woven into a complex tapestry, and drawn with an intensity to leave a lasting impression. Her research includes a range of direct experience, lending her fantasy a gritty realism, and her scenes involving magic an almost visionary credibility. A self&#x2013;taught painter, she draws directly from the imagination, creating scenes in a representational style that blurs the edges between dream and reality. She makes no preliminary sketches, but envisions her characters and the scenes that contain them, then executes the final directly from the initial pencil drawing.</p><p>The seed idea for the Wars of Light and Shadow series occurred, when, in the course of researching tactic and weapons, she viewed a documentary film on the Battle of Culloden Moor. This was the first time she had encountered the historical context of that brutal event, with the embroidery of romance stripped from it. The experience gave rise to an awakening, which became anger, that so often, our education, literature and entertainment slant history in a manner that equates winners and losers with moral right and wrong, and the prevalent attitude, that killing wars can be seen as justifiable solutions when only one side of the picture is presented. </p><p>Her series takes the stance that there are two sides to every question, and follows two characters who are half brothers. One a bard trained as a master of magecraft, and the other a born ruler with a charismatic passion for justice, have become cursed to lifelong enmity. As one sibling raises a devoted mass following, the other tries desperately to stave off defeat through solitary discipline and cleverness. The conflict sweeps across an imaginary world, dividing land and people through an intricate play of politics and the inborn prejudices of polarized factions already set at odds. Readers are led on a journey that embraces both viewpoints. The story explores the ironies of morality which often confound our own human condition-that what appears right and just, by one side, becomes reprehensible when seen from the opposite angle. What is apparently good for the many, too often causes devastating suffering to the nonconformist minority. Through the interactions between the characters themselves, the reader is left to their own discretion to interpret the moral impact of events. </p><p>Says Janny of her work, "I chose to frame this story against a backdrop of fantasy because I could handle even the most sensitive issues with the gloves off-explore the myriad angles of our troubled times with the least risk of offending anyone's personal sensibilities. The result, I can hope, is an expanding journey of the spirit that explores the grand depths, and rises to the challenge of mapping the ethereal potential of an evolving planetary consciousness." </p><p>Beyond writing, Janny's award winning paintings have been showcased in exhibitions of imaginative artwork, among them a commemorative exhibition for NASA's 25th Anniversary; the Art of the Cosmos at Hayden Planetarium in New York; and two exhibits of fantasy art, at both the Delaware Art Museum, and Canton Art Museum.</p></p><h2>The Barbarians are Coming</h2><p>The author of the awardwinning Pangs of Love returns with a powerful portrait of the ChineseAmerican experience centered on Sterling Lung, a man caught between two worlds. A first novel.</p><p>In David Wong Louie's finely crafted, funny, and exceptionally well-written coming-of-age story set in the late '70s, a young Chinese American struggles toward the American dream of affluence, leaving behind his befuddled immigrant parents and their small apartment over their laundry business. The narrator of <i>The Barbarian's Are Coming</i> has been trained at the Culinary Institute of America and is ready to rise to any challenge a capon or a champignon can offer. Newly appointed resident chef of the Richfield Ladies' Club in Connecticut, Sterling Lung ignores his well-coifed employers' urgings that he cook Chinese food for them. His father, on the other hand, who wanted Sterling to become a doctor, takes his revenge by never allowing his son to cook for him. Aging and unwell, he nurses a bittersweet anger at having raised a child who knows almost nothing about his family's culture, who speaks little Chinese, and who prides himself on his ignorance of Chinese cooking. On the one occasion Sterling is allowed to cook in her kitchen, his mother scowls over his shoulder, criticizing every move. "You call yourself a chef?" she prods him. <blockquote> "Didn't they teach you anything at that school?" She clucks her tongue and goes to the refrigerators and returns with a bottle. "Oyster sauce is always good." The store-bought sauce is against everything I've ever learned about gastronomy. Sauces are the supreme test of a chef's skill. Often, cooking is the sauce. But sauce out of a bottle, some anonymous committee of tongues in a laboratory determining the proper blend of flavors for <i>my</i> palate, <i>my</i> dishes? I read the label: "Oyster extractives, sugar, water, monosodium glutamate, salt, cornstarch, caramel color." Why not ketchup? Why not Drano? </blockquote> In a last bid to set Sterling up in the only way they know how, his parents bring a "picture bride" from China to marry him. At the same moment, a relationship he had assumed was casual suddenly and alarmingly metamorphoses, as his girlfriend announces that she's pregnant.<p> Louie's much-lauded 1991 short-story collection, <i>Pangs of Love</i>, gave hints of his future development. In his first novel, as promised, he shows a narrative ingenuity as remarkable as his cultural insights. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p><b>David Wong Louie</b> is the author of <b>Pangs of Love</b>, winner of the Los Angeles Times First Fiction Award and the Ploughshares First Book Award.

Reaching from the classics to the post-moderns, his allusions dance from Samuel Johnson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and M. F. K. Fisher to Marilynne Robinson, Hunter S. Thompson, and David Foster Wallace. Dirda's topics are equally diverse: literary pets, the lost art of cursive writing, book inscriptions, the pleasures of science fiction conventions, author photographs, novelists in old age, Oberlin College, a year in Marseille, writer's block, and much more, not to overlook a few rants about Washington life and American culture. As admirers of his earlier books will expect, there are annotated lists galore of perfect book titles, great adventure novels, favorite words, essential books about books, and beloved children's classics, as well as a revealing peek at the titles Michael keeps on his own nightstand.

In 1932 he gave up the theater to devote his attention to his studies in mysticism when he began his lecture career in New York City.

Each instance&#x2014;often as shocking as it is compelling&#x2014;is a clear illustration of the risks posed to individual liberties in our modern society. And, in Shipler&#x2019;s hands, each serves as a powerful incitement for a retrieval of these precious rights. <br><br>A brilliant, immeasurably important book for our time.</p><p><b>A Letter from Author David K.

I wouldn&#x2019;t mind if they peeked into my life as long as I don&#x2019;t notice them there.&#x201d; <p></p> She captured perfectly the warring attitudes that coexist in the country at large. Violations of the Bill of Rights are considered outrageous when they are obvious and physical, but when they are out of sight, they are out of mind. That leaves government with latitude to do invisible electronic searches without generating much public opposition. <p></p> I came to understand the issue as a problem of perception, illustrated neatly by Publishers Weekly, which called electronic surveillance &#x201c;less intrusive&#x201d; than pedestrian frisks by policemen looking for guns. Those visible violations were &#x201c;shocking.&#x201d; Yes, but if investigators without showing probable cause can wire your bedroom for sound, copy your daughter&#x2019;s hard drive, tape your phone conversations, read your e-mail, monitor your Web browsing, collect a decade of your travel and medical and financial records, and follow your location through your cell phone or a GPS device planted secretly on your car, how is that &#x201c;less intrusive?&#x201d; <p></p> Most of those steps were taken against the innocent lawyer Brandon Mayfield, whom I profiled in the book. I&#x2019;ll bet, if offered a choice between those and a one-time frisk, Mayfield would have picked the pat-down. <p></p> I ended this project worrying about complacency. If we cannot mobilize sufficient concern about what we cannot see, then the invisible surveillance will continue undermining the Fourth Amendment without the resistance required to preserve our rights. <p></p><b>David K.

Early in McCaffrey&#x2019;s forty-six-year career as a writer, she became the first woman to win a Hugo Award for fiction and the first to win a Nebula Award. Her 1978 novel <i>The White Dragon</i> became one of the first science fiction books to appear on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list. In 1999 she was the recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards Award, honoring her lifetime contribution to writing for teens. In 2005 the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named McCaffrey its twenty-second Grand Master, an annual award to living writers of fantasy and science fiction.

The story of merchant shipping is the story of takeover coups by such figures as financier J.P. Morgan, luxury wars that sacrificed quality (especially disastrous in the case of the Titanic), underbidding tactics (such as those wielded by Japan early in this century), congressional legislation that reshuffled the lineup of top firms, bankruptcy scandals that depleted the federal treasury, progress in control and regulation, and, above all, America's sudden and short-lived pre-eminence in international marine commerce.<br>To provide this richly detailed history of U.S. merchant shipping since 1901 - when Morgan's infamous International Mercantile Marine (IMM) launched America on the high seas of world trade - Rene De La Pedraja has accessed unpublished business records and government archives. His original, in-depth research has resulted in the definitive chronological account of U.S. merchant shipping up to the present, covering the establishment of the Shipping Board in World War I; the decline and rebirth of the American merchant fleet; the rise of shipping in the Gulf, Asia, and the South Pacific; Roosevelt's New Deal for shipping; World War II and the War shipping administration; the decline of the U.S. tanker fleet; the growth of governmental regulatory agencies; the effects of the Cuban revolution; the energy crisis; and, ultimately, the "great shakeout" and the survivors.<br>De La Pedraja introduces vital yet little-known facts about numerous fascinating individuals and the fast-changing fortunes of such major enterprises as Pacific Mail, United Fruit, American-Hawaiian, Lykes Brothers, Waterman, Moore-McCormack, Delta, McLean, and many others. His observations add new shape and definition to our overall picture of American business history. He explains, for example, why cheap foreign labor and the resulting competition in the marketplace hit the U.S. shipping industry much earlier and harder than it hit the American steel and automobile industries.<br>This is vital reading for scholars, students, policy-makers and business executives seeking a clearer picture of American business history and a secure grasp of how U.S. industry functions in a competitive and often volatile domestic and international setting.</p><p>De la Pedraja offers a comprehensive study of the governmental and private policies that have led to dominance of the shipping lanes by U.S. companies at various times during this century--and to the virtual disappearance of U.S. shipping in recent decades. He illustrates how U.S. shipping lines, which often led the way with such innovations as oil-fired steamships and container shipping, have squandered their position of leadership through bad decisions at all levels. The author's principal question is whether the United States ought to have a coherent policy toward merchant shipping, as European and Asian countries have historically. He has documented his subject well, and his writing style makes the volume of information readily accessible. Recommended for academic libraries and large public collections.<br><i>- Joseph C.

The vitamin and herbal supplement industry generates over $20 billion a year by selling products that promise to cure or fix, but are produced and marketed essentially without oversight. And while the media has been quick to sensationalize the benefits of supplements, few have taken a hard look at the dangers posed by many of the remedies flooding the market today. Award-winning journalist Dan Hurley breaks the silence for the first time in <i>Natural Causes. </i><br>From the snake-oil salesmen of the early twentieth century, to rise of the health food movement in the sixties and seventies, Hurley charts the remarkable growth of an industry built largely on fraud, and reveals the backroom politics that led to the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which effectively freed the industry from FDA oversight. In unprecedented detail, he shows how supplement manufacturers have concealed the truth about dozens of untested treatments and the shocking rise in deaths, disfigurements, and life-threatening injuries caused by products deceptively promoted as &#x201c;safe and natural.&#x201d; Most importantly, he provides a telling look at why, in an age of unprecedented scientific advancement, we continue to buy and believe in remedies for which little evidence exists&#x2014;and why the supplements we take to promote our health may be doing far more harm than good. <br>As Hurley shows, the dietary supplement craze may be one of the greatest swindles ever perpetrated on the American public&#x2014;one that feeds billions of dollars each year into the pockets of lobbyists, politicians, and any charlatan who wants to slap a label on a bottle and tout it as the next big &#x201c;natural cure.&#x201d; Blending hard facts with spellbinding personal stories, <i>Natural Causes</i> is a must-read for anyone who has ever popped a multivitamin or an herb, and provides a hard-hitting, frightening look at a cultural trend that is out of control.</p></p><p><p><b>dan hurley </b>is an award-winning journalist specializing in health and medical writing, and a regular contributor to the <i>New York Times. </i>His work has also appeared in the <i>Houston Chronicle, Men&#x2019;s Health, Psychology Today, </i>and many other publications.

A hundred years ago, during the great patent medicine era, American consumers could buy Tex Bailey's Rattle Snake Oil (made not in Texas but in Troy, N.Y.); Tex Allen's Rattlesnake Essential Oil Compound, recommended for &#x201c;rheumatic pains, back pain, strains, sprains, bruises, sores, aching feet, stiff joints, sore muscles, throat irritation, headache, earache, and more&#x201d; (manufactured in Newark, N.J.); Rattlesnake Bill's Liniment, &#x201c;made from the fat of a real diamondback rattlesnake&#x201d; (manufactured in exotic Belleville, N.J.); the Great Yaquis Snake-Oil Liniment; Blackhawks Indian Liniment Oil; Monster Brand Snake Oil; and Mack Mahon the Rattle Snake Oil King's Liniment for Rheumatism and Catarrh.<br><br>Far from having the negative connotation we give it today, snake oil in those days was sold on the basis of Americans&#x2019; infatuation with cowboys, the Old West, and Indians. No one better exploited that fascination than Clark Stanley, another self-crowned &#x201c;Rattle Snake King.&#x201d; In a fifty-page booklet he published in 1897, Stanley gave the first twenty&#x2013;five pages over to the colorful life of cowboys before devoting the remaining pages to the wonders of snake oil. With handlebar mustache, goatee, broad&#x2013;brimmed hat, boots, kerchief, and jeans, he certainly looked the part of a cowboy. The story he told of his life was a compelling one: Born in Abilene, Texas, around the time of the Civil War, he lived the life of a cowboy from the age of fourteen to twenty&#x2013;five. Then, in the spring of 1879, he followed some of his father's friends to Walpi, Arizona, to see the snake dance of the Moki (now known as the Hopi) Indians.<br><br>&#x201c;There I became acquainted with the medicine man of the Moki tribe,&#x201d; Stanley wrote in his booklet, &#x201c;and as he liked the looks of my Colt&#x2019;s revolver and asked me to show him how it would shoot, I gave him an exhibition of my fancy shooting, which pleased him very much; he then asked me how I would like to stay there and live with him, I told him I would stay until the snake dance.&#x201d; After witnessing the dance, his father's friends left, but Stanley decided to stay on, and he lived with the Moki for two years and five months.<br><br>&#x201c;I learned their language and dances and the secret of making their medicines,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;The medicine that interested me most was their Snake Oil Medicine as they called it. It is used for rheumatism, contracted cords and all aches and pains. As I was thought a great deal of by the medicine man, he gave me the secret of making the Snake Oil Medicine, which is now named Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment. Snake Oil is not a new discovery, it has been in use by the Mokis and other Indian tribes for many generations, and I have made an improvement on the original formula.&#x201d;<br><br>There are no independent historic documents attesting to how much, if any, of Stanley&#x2019;s story is true. But he certainly seemed to know a great deal about the cowboy life, and it is accurate that the Hopi Indians held snake dances in Walpi, Arizona; President Teddy Roosevelt would attend one in the summer of 1913. But in any case, Stanley's story continued with the turning point that stories such as these almost always have: he tried it on some friends and neighbors back home, and it was such a great cure that soon he was manufacturing it and selling it with great success. By his account, Stanley traveled the West and Southwest for some ten years, selling his snake oil &#x201c;with unbounded success.&#x201d;<br><br>Then came the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago&#x2014;the largest public event in the history of the United States to date, where President Grover Cleveland threw an electric switch to open it, the Ferris wheel made its international debut, and more than 25 million people attended during its six&#x2013;month course. Here, dressed in his colorful cowboy outfit, Stanley made a show of handling snakes.<br><br>In the only surviving interview of Stanley conducted by an independent source, he described his routine this way: &#x201c;The audience see [sic] me kill the snakes, draw out the oil and put it into a glass dish. Then I walk down among them and show it to them. Then, I go back and here is a big glass jar, like you make orangeade in. First, I put the snake oil in, and then I put nine other oils in which have previously been mixed in a can, so that they don't see all of what my formula is. I pour that in on top of the snake oil, turn the mixture around, and if it doesn&#x2019;t mix thoroughly, looks a little cloudy, I stir it again. Then I let it set for just a moment, and it becomes clear.&#x201d;<br><br>Then he would sell the freshly prepared snake oil liniment, along with many other bottles previously made. As the months passed, he met druggists from across the United States, including one from Boston who persuaded him to move there and open a manufacturing plant.<br><br>So it was that, according to a copy of a <i>Boston Transcript</i> article reprinted in Stanley&#x2019;s booklet, a reporter found him at his office at 67 Park Street in nearby Beverly with a house full of snakes. &#x201c;The snake man took the reporter up to his bedroom, and opening a light wooden box, with a wire window in the side, dove his hand into it with as much unconcern as if he were taking an egg out of a basket, and brought it out again with a snake seven feet long writhing in it.&#x201d; Eventually he pulled out two more large venomous snakes and allowed them to twine themselves around his body, their forked black tongues flicking in and out against his skin.<br><br>&#x201c;The bite of any one of these snakes is absolutely deadly,&#x201d; Stanley told the reporter. &#x201c;No, I am not the least afraid of being bitten. In fact, I have been bitten hundreds of times. Look here!&#x201d; He showed his hands, which were covered to the wrists in tiny white scars. Not all were from poisonous snakes, he said, but he continued, &#x201c;I have also been bitten by snakes which had their glands full of poison, and meant business. The reason I am not dead is because I have what I believe is the only remedy for snake-bite, and there is no question that it is a perfect one.&#x201d;<br><br>While it is possible that Stanley gradually built up a limited immunity to venomous snake bites, as other snake handlers have done, there was not any effective &#x201c;remedy&#x201d; for such bites in those days. Today, the only treatment is antivenom, made by injecting small amounts of venom into an animal and then harvesting the immune cells that the animal's blood generates.<br><br>By 1901, Stanley had moved to a bigger manufacturing plant in Providence, Rhode Island, where he claimed to have killed three thousand snakes for his snake oil the previous year, as well as two thousand more at his &#x201c;snake farm&#x201d; in Texas. "In covered pens may be seen thousands of snakes fattened ready to be killed for their oil,&#x201d; a reporter wrote. &#x201c;Clark Stanley says that the world is just beginning to realize the actual value of snake oil and that there are hundreds of uses to which it might be applied that are not yet recognized.&#x201d;<br><br>His labeling, as well as the accompanying booklet, attempted to scratch the surface of those hundreds of uses: &#x201c;For Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Sciatica, Lame Back, Contracted Muscles, Sprains, Swellings, Frost Bites, Chilblains, Bruises, Sore Throat, Bites of Animals, Insects and Reptiles. Good for Man and Beast. A Liniment that penetrates Muscle, Membrane and Tissue to the very bone itself, and banishing pain with a power that has astonished the Medical Profession.&#x201d; Two figures illustrated the &#x201c;best method for curing Partial Paralysis of the Arms.&#x201d; Another figure illustrated &#x201c;the way to bathe the head for Neuralgia, Headache, Tic Douloureux.&#x201d; For the bites of animals, insects, or reptiles, Clark Stanley&#x2019;s Snake Oil Liniment was to &#x201c;be applied as soon as possible. It kills the poison, relieves the pain, reduces the swelling and heals the wound.&#x201d;<br><b>On</b> the day Columbus first set foot in the New World at San Salvador in 1492, he wrote in his journal, &#x201c;The natives brought fruit, wooden spears, and certain dried leaves which gave off a distinct fragrance.&#x201d; The dried leaves, it turned out, were tobacco, the first pharmacologically active herb (due to its nicotine content) brought back to Europe&#x2014;not that tobacco would ever be regulated as a drug, despite being an addictive stimulant.<br><br>&#x201c;When we discovered the New World, the Old World was looking for cures for diseases,&#x201d; says Michael R. Harris, who served as the historian of pharmacy at the Smithsonian Institution for twenty-six years before becoming the historian and curator at the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum. He also consulted as a historian to the television show <i>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</i>. Beyond cures, Harris says, people wanted stimulants. That&#x2019;s why when tobacco, coffee, and tea all hit world markets in the sixteenth century, &#x201c;they became instant hits worldwide. No drugs, except later for the amphetamines, have spread around the world so quickly.&#x201d;<br><br>In 1632, Catholic Jesuits who had gone to Peru brought back a powder from the cinchona tree, which natives used to bring down the fevers of malaria. In Europe, no effective treatment had been known for malaria, and physicians were soon calling the &#x201c;Jesuit bark&#x201d; as important a development in medicine as gunpowder was to warfare. The powder, French scientists would determine nearly two centuries later, contained quinine. When it cured the malarial fevers of King Charles II of England, it confirmed the view that great medicines could be found in the forests of the New World.<br><br>Indeed, today it is estimated that more than one fourth of modern medicines are derived from botanicals, including aspirin, from willow bark, and the cancer-fighting compound paclitaxel (Taxol), from the...</p><h2>1000 Paintings of Genius</h2><p>From the early Renaissance through Baroque and Romanticism to Cubism, Surrealism, and Pop, these canonical works of Western Art span eight centuries and a east range of subjects.

In conversational tones, John talks about how he has overcome a sleeping disorder that affects about one-third of the adult population in America and lays out a blueprint showing how sufferers don&#39;t have to spend their nights tossing and turning and their days struggling to stay awake. John uses his &#34;on-the-job&#34; experience to guide readers through a program that will help them develop healthy habits that promote a restful and peaceful night of slumber. Desperately Seeking Snoozing is the one book that can boast that it will put you to sleep.</p><p>"Professional insomniac" John Wiedman isn't a doctor; he researched and developed this anti-insomnia program in order to overcome his own sleep problems. His recommendation is that people suffering from severe insomnia should actually restrict their sleeping time to the bare minimum they need to function during the day. Some may find this a difficult prescription, but judging from his readers' testimonials, it can work. <i>Desperately Seeking Snoozin'</i> also includes general information about sleep medications, lifestyle changes that can affect sleep, and how eating late at night can affect the sleep cycle. The book is rounded out with messages from insomnia chat boards on the Internet, which give a sense of the amount of genuine suffering sleep problems can cause. <i>--Ben Kallen</i>Last year I cured my lifelong chronic insomnia and wrote Desperately Seeking Snoozin' about my experience and cure.

As I am neither a writer nor a medical professional, I was amazed by their responses. <p>I was even more surprised by the reaction of the medical community. I was particularly pleased with the quote, "A book that every insomniac should read", by Dr. Peter Hauri, considered by many to be the world's leading authority on insomnia.

Rowling's spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling's fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. <p> The heart of Book 7 is a hero's mission--not just in Harry's quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore's warning about making the choice between "what is right and what is easy," and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling's skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. </p><p> A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix's flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> </p><p> <strong>Deluxe Edition Details</strong> <br>The Deluxe Edition includes an exclusive insert featuring near-scale reproductions of Mary GrandPr�'s interior art, as well as never-before-seen full-color frontispiece art on special paper.

Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series.

The victors, however, valued vengeance even more than stability and demanded a massive indemnity from Germany in order to keep it from rearming. The results, as eminent historian Norman Stone describes in this authoritative history, were disastrous.<br><br>In <i>World War Two</i>, Stone provides a remarkably concise account of the deadliest war of human history, showing how the conflict roared to life from the ashes of World War One. Adolf Hitler rode a tide of popular desperation and resentment to power in Germany, promptly making good on his promise to return the nation to its former economic and military strength. He bullied Europe into giving him his way, and in so doing backed the victors of the Great War into a corner. Following the invasion of Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany&#x2014;a decision that, Stone argues, was utterly irrational. Yet Hitler had driven the world mad, and the rekindling of European hostilities soon grew to a conflagration that spread across the globe, fanned by political and racial ideologies more poisonous&#x2014;and weaponry more destructive&#x2014;than the world had ever seen. With commanding expertise, Stone leads readers through the escalation, climax, and mournful denouement of this sprawling conflict.<br><br><i>World War Two</i> is an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the twentieth century and its defining struggle.<br><br></p><p>Norman Stone has taught at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Bilkent, where he is now Director of the Turkish-Russian Center. Stone is the author of <i>World War One, The Eastern Front, 1914-1917</i> (winner of the Wolfson Prize), and <i>Europe Transformed</i>.<b><i>Daily Mail</i> (London), Book of the Week</b><br> Of all the books about World War II, this must be one of the most unexpected. Norman Stone, a master historian, has elected to tell the whole story in just 200 pages. Reading it is like being taken up in an all-seeing satellite to observe massive movements on the ground, or the woods without any trees to get in the way. It is illuminating, concentrating on what mattered most psychologically, ignoring confusing detail.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Richard J. Evans, <i>New Statesman</i></b><br> [Norman Stone] has a real gift for saying a lot in a small space and many sections of this book are masterpieces of compression.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The Telegraph</b></i><b> (London)</b><br> [Stone's] history is a gripping introduction to one of the most tragic conflicts ever seen.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Sunday Express</b></i><b> (London)</b><br> Love or loathe him, Stone can pull off tricks beyond the reach of most of his detractors. Take his World War II: A Short History; do we really need yet another mini survey of the 1939-45 conflict? Of course not. Except if it is written by Norman Stone. Pithy, opinionated, preposterously readable, an afternoon on the sofa should see you through from cover to cover and Stone's book fires off illuminating facts as a Catherine wheel showers sparks.... [An] excellent, engaged and engaging primer, which contains everything and misses nothing in its brief span.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> [An] entertaining history . Novices will receive a painless introduction, but educated readers should not pass up the highly opinionated prologue and epilogue and the author's trademark acerbic commentary throughout . Readers of all stripes will find plenty to ponder.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Ian Thomson, <i>The Spectator</i></b><br> Written in a precise, carefully modulated prose, World War Two is illuminating as well as often amusing.... This absorbing micro-history serves as a tonic to outsize histories, and is pleasingly digressive as well as wonderfully well written. Professor Stone is a one-off and we are fortunate to have him.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Andrew Roberts, <i>Standpoint</i></b><br>"Norman Stone has achieved the impossible; he has somehow written a comprehensive history of the Second World War in just under 200 pages, summarising the entire conflict while leaving out nothing of importance and bringing his lifetime of study of the subject to bear in a witty, incisive and immensely readable way . Not everyone will agree with all the conclusions...but none will doubt that Norman Stone has proved yet again that he is one of the most original, witty and powerful British historians writing today."<br><br><i><b>Mail on Sunday</b></i><b> (London)</b><br> Stone's book is an entertaining read, full of quirky detail.... For the well-informed, this will be a book to enjoy, then argue over.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Daily Telegraph</i> (London)</b><br> Stone always avoids the obvious, and his talent for seeing unexpected routes of cause and effect define his brilliant histories, of which his latest, <i>World War Two: A Short History</i>, is the fifth. Such lines of inquiry not only revivify the subjects they cover, they throw up all sorts of interesting nuggets.... Stone tells the story of the war succinctly and fluently, looking at areas often ignored in English histories.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>San Antonio Express-News</i></b><br> An amazingly concise but seam-busting account of a war that defined America's greatest generation, [World War Two] will fascinate the novice historian and satisfy the WWII scholar. Stone...solidifies his reputation as a British academic, author and celebrated chronicler of military history with this succinct work.... Stone masterfully dissects his subject and puts it back together in a concise and straightforward approach that will give readers a firm foundation.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Roanoke Times</b></i><br> Only a person with extensive knowledge can tell such a complex story in so few pages and still have it be comprehensive. This is an ideal book for someone who seeks to understand the nature of World War II. It is also appropriate reading for someone who has studied the war in fragments...and wants to be reminded of the grand scale of this massive conflagration that defined the 20th century.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Only Negotiating Guide You&#39;ll Ever Need: 101 Ways to Win Every Time in Any Situation</h2><p>The Essential Guide to the Power of Persuasion<br><br>In <i>The Only Negotiating Guide You&#x2019;ll Ever Need</i>, Peter Stark and Jane Flaherty, celebrated consultants to some of the country&#x2019;s top companies, take the dread out of persuasion.

Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor-the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. <br>Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in "The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in "The Return of the King.<br>In the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, 111-year-old Bilbo Baggins (hero of The Hobbit) passed along his magical ring to his orphaned nephew, Frodo--unwittingly setting its original owner, the horrible Gollum, on his trail.

Magnificent, tyrannical, a strong ruler, a 'pillager of the commonwealth', this most notorious of kings remains a figure of extreme contradictions: a devout traditionalist who oversaw a cataclysmic rupture with the church in Rome; a talented, charismatic, imposing figure who nevertheless could not bear to meet people's eyes when he talked to them. In this revealing new account, John Guy explores how Henry himself understood the world and his place in it - from his sheltered and increasingly isolated upbringing and the blazing glory of his accession; to his desperate quest for recognition, fame and an heir, and the terrifying paranoia of his last, agonising, 54-inch-waisted years - and in doing so casts new light on his choice of wives and ministers, his impact on the European stage, and his extraordinary legacy.</p></p><p>John Guy is a Fellow of Clare College, University of Cambridge. His bestselling books include <i>A Daughter's Love: Thomas and Margaret More</i>, <i>Thomas Becket: Warrior, Priest, Rebel, Victim: A 900-Year-Old Story Retold</i>, <i>Tudor England, The Children of Henry VIII</i>, and <i>'My Heart is My Own': the Life of Mary Queen of Scots</i>, which won the Whitbread Biography Award and the Marsh Biography Award.

Over the years, participants have including many leading representatives of religion, science, and philosophy. This series has as its subject, <em>The Development of Mind.</em> First published in 1972, the series continues to attract widespread interest. In this volume, contributors argue about the mind from diverse analytical standpoints.</p><p>The focus of the series remains the relationship between religion, science, and philosophy. This volume attempts to achieve a comprehensive view of the subject of mind. The mental development of children in the light of modern psychology is discussed, and the distinction between "how" and "why" questions is put forward with clarity. The development of mind is further contrasted with the evolution of embryos in the young. The mind is considered as a capacity for intellectual activity, and as a multi-purpose program. Goal-directed behavior and language development are given importance, and issues of cosmic purpose, and the how and why of evolution, are never far from the surface of the argument.</p><p>The lecturers know their opposition and their positions, and the cut-and-thrust of the discussion has much acumen and wit to it. Issues ranging from the impact of mind on theories of religion, causation, and rational will are examined in an informal, yet compelling, manner.</p></p><p><p> A. J. P.

Its ideas of transporters and warp drives, of androids and holodecks have penetrated the cultural imagination. <br> Justin McLachlan, an award-winning journalist, explores the current state of our technology and what's waiting for us just on the horizon. With the help of experts in the fields of robotics, physics, artificial intelligence and more, he looks not just at the science behind Star Trek's technology, not just at our abilities and our challenges, but beyond the question of "Can we?" to also ask, "Should we?" How would humankind treat a race of androids? Would holodecks only isolate us in a world where human interaction doesn't exist? Can machines that learn ever be truly controlled? Should they be? <br> These questions are more important now than ever, as the pace of technological innovation outstrips even the imaginations of Star Trek's writers. What McLachlan finds in Treknology, an entertaining and though-provoking read, is that much of the Star Trek's technology and the questions it poses for mankind is not just within our technological grasp, but much of it is already here - 300 years ahead of the future.</p><p>Journalist.

Her words combine immediacy with acute observation, and deep personal involvement with professional detachment. Complementing her writing here are two hundred remarkable photographs from the Lee Miller Archives. They show war-ravaged cities, buildings, and landscapes; but above all they portray war-resilient people&#x2014;soldiers, leaders, medics, evacuees, prisoners of war, the wounded, the villains, and the heroes.<br><br>There is the raw edge of combat portrayed at the siege of St. Malo and in the bitterly fought Alsace campaign, and the disbelief and outrage Miller describes on witnessing the victims of Dachau. The war's horror is relieved by the spirit of postliberation Paris, where she indulged in frivolous fashions and recorded memorable conversations with Picasso, Cocteau, Eluard, Aragon, and Colette. The book ends with Miller's on-the-scene report giving a sardonic description of Hitler's abandoned house in Munich and the looting and burning of his alpine fortress at Berchtesgaden, which marked a symbolic end to the war. 160 duotone illustrations.</p><p><b>David E.

In Zemach's interpretation, a poor woodcutter and his wife are working in the forest when they hear a faint voice calling: "Help, someone help me!" They promptly rescue an imp whose tail is caught under a fallen tree, and in return he rewards them with three wishes. "Wish wisely, my friends," the imp says in parting. Prophetic words indeed.<br>It soon looks as if this windfall will be nothing but trouble for the woodcutter and his wife. The legendary dilemma they face--which involves a long string of sausages--is subtly dramatized in Zemach's simple text and wry yet heartfelt pictures. She takes particular joy in showing how, in the end, the woodcutter and his wife get just what they wanted all along.<br>Margot Zemach won the Caldecott Medal for "Duffy and the Devil" and was the United States nominee for the 1980 Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration.<br></p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 3 With Zemach's new edition of the traditional English tale, one's wishes are granted. Her retelling is a simple one, yet the language is rich with images: "All that cold day, they were warmed by thoughts of the three wishes. . . ." Slight changes from earlier versions emphasize the spirit of goodness of this woodcutting couple and the love that is evident between them. Zemach's inviting illustrationswatercolors in hues of blue and brown on cream paperadd humor to the tale, as when they show the couple's dog attempting to get a taste of the string of sausages hanging from his master's nose. At the end, the satisfied couple, feasting on the sausages that they wished off of the man's nose with their final wish, agree that, "We've not done too badly." Neither will librarians who choose this edition to share with childrenindividually or in a story hour grouphave done too badly. This is the best single edition of an old favorite. David Gale, "School Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Much of the joy of old stories comes when readers rediscover them. Zemach's version of the tale about the woodcutter who frees an imp and gets three wishes has a contemporary touch for its old-fashioned settingthe man and woman work together as woodcutters to eke out their spare living. When they roll a tree off the tail of a trapped imp, he gives them the wishes and warns them to be wise. Despite all care, though, the man accidently wishes for sausages. In anger, the wife wishes that those sausages be on his nose. Finally, they must wish the sausages off; a fine sausage dinner repays them for their trouble. Zemach keeps her color palette natural, with sky blues and deep browns of the woods and cabin and a stone gray for the fire place; her sausages seem to sizzle and smoke off the page. It's a fetching edition of a favorite story, by one of our finest storytellers. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>X-Men: The Trial of Gambit</h2><p>For years, they have loved each other from a safe distance.

And even if you&#x2019;re part of that unionized 10 percent, chances are your union doesn't carry much economic or political clout. But this was not always the case, as historian and activist James Young shows in this vibrant story of the United Electrical Workers Union. The UE, built by hundreds of rank-and-file worker-activists in the quintessentially industrial town of Erie, Pennsylvania, was able to transform the conditions of the working class largely because it went beyond the standard call for living wages to demand quantum leaps in worker control over workplaces, community institutions, and the policies of the federal government itself.</p> <p>James Young's book is a richly empowering history told from below, showing that the collective efforts of the many can challenge the supremacy of the few. Erie's two UE locals confronted a daunting array of obstacles: the corporate superpower General Electric; ferocious red baiting; and later, the debilitating impact of globalization. Yet, by working through and across ethnic, gender, and racial divides, communities of people built a viable working-class base powered by real democracy. While the union's victories could not be sustained completely, the UE is still alive and fighting in Erie. This book is an exuberant and eloquent testament to this fight, and a reminder to every worker&#x2014;employed or unemployed; in a union or out&#x2014;that an injury to one is an injury to all.</p></p><p><p>James Young is Professor of History Emeritus at Edinboro University, Pennsylvania. He has been a union member all his life and a worker in several unions, including the SEIU and USWA. He is a contributing author to <em>Fear Itself: Enemies Real and Imagined in American Culture</em> and <em>Advocates and Activists, 1919-1941: Men and Women Who Shaped the Period Between the Wars.</em></p>&#x201c;That the United Electrical Workers Union was still alive at the end of the 1950s, a decade of redbaiting, raids, and repression against the labor left, has been considered a minor miracle. In this wonderfully detailed account of human courage and solidarity, based on dozens of interviews with participants, Jim Young uncovers the secret behind that miracle.

Widely regarded as one of the most talented romance writers today, she was a five-time winner of Romance Writers of America&#x2019;s cherished RITA Award and one of only a handful of members of the RWA Hall of Fame. She also twice received the <i>Romantic Times</i> Career Achievement Award. She had two grown sons and lived with her husband in England. Jo Beverley passed away in May 2016.This slow-moving addition to Beverley's Company of Rogues series (<i>St. Raven</i>, etc.) fails to hold the reader's attention, despite its likable protagonists. Laura, "Lady Skylark" to the London elite, was a dazzling 18-year-old when she married Hal Gardeyne, the heir to the Caldfort estate. Six years later, Laura, now a widow, finds herself a virtual prisoner at Caldfort, kept there because she can't leave her son, Harry, in the hands of Hal's forbidding family. Worse, she suspects that Harry may be in danger because he's next in line to inherit Caldfort, and if something were to happen to him, his possibly malevolent uncle Jack could claim the estate. When Laura discovers a mysterious letter implying there may be a missing heir to the estate, she teams up with her old friend, Stephen Ball, and devises a plan to whisk Harry to safety and uncover the secret behind the missing heir. For much of the novel, Laura and Stephen secretly pine for each other as they share close quarters in a little seaside town, but their scruples prevent them from acting on their shared passion. The mystery, which hinges precariously on some overheard phrases and unfounded suppositions, develops just as slowly, and readers may have a tough time holding out for the denouement.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Let&#x2019;s get out of here!<br> <br>&#x201c;Turk! Turk! I&#x2019;m shot!&#x201d;<br> <br>I could hear Turk&#x2019;s voice calling from a far distance, telling me not to go into the fish-and-chips joint. I heard, but I didn&#x2019;t understand. The only thing I knew was that I was going to die.<br> <br>I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all thirteen years of it.<br> <br>I climbed up on the bar yelling, &#x201c;Walsh, I&#x2019;m shot. I&#x2019;m shot.&#x201d; I could feel the blood running down my leg. Walsh, the fellow who operated the fish-and-chips joint, pushed me off the bar and onto the floor. I couldn&#x2019;t move now, but I was still completely conscious.<br> <br>Walsh was saying, &#x201c;Git outta here, kid. I ain&#x2019;t got no time to play.&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman was screaming, mumbling something about the Lord, and saying, &#x201c;Somebody done shot that poor child.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mama ran in. She jumped up and down, screaming like a crazy woman. I began to think about dying. The worst part of dying was thinking about the things and the people that I&#x2019;d never see again. As I lay there trying to imagine what being dead was like, the policeman who had been trying to control Mama gave up and bent over me. He asked who had shot me. Before I could answer, he was asking me if I could hear him. I told him that I didn&#x2019;t know who had shot me and would he please tell Mama to stop jumping up and down. Every time Mama came down on that shabby floor, the bullet lodged in my stomach felt like a hot poker.<br> <br>Another policeman had come in and was struggling to keep the crowd outside. I could see Turk in the front of the crowd. Before the cops came, he asked me if I was going to tell them that he was with me. I never answered. I looked at him and wondered if he saw who shot me. Then his question began to ring in my head: &#x201c;Sonny, you gonna tell &#x2019;em I was with you?&#x201d; I was bleeding on a dirty floor in a fish-and-chips joint, and Turk was standing there in the doorway hoping that I would die before I could tell the cops that he was with me. Not once did Turk ask me how I felt.<br> <br>Hell, yeah, I thought, I&#x2019;m gonna tell &#x2019;em.<br> <br>It seemed like hours had passed before the ambulance finally arrived. Mama wanted to go to the hospital with me, but the ambulance attendant said she was too excited. On the way to Harlem Hospital, the cop who was riding with us asked Dad what he had to say. His answer was typical: &#x201c;I told him about hanging out with those bad-ass boys.&#x201d; The cop was a little surprised. This must be a rookie, I thought.<br> <br>The next day, Mama was at my bedside telling me that she had prayed and the Lord had told her that I was going to live. Mama said that many of my friends wanted to donate some blood for me, but the hospital would not accept it from narcotics users.<br> <br>This was one of the worst situations I had ever been in. There was a tube in my nose that went all the way to the pit of my stomach. I was being fed intravenously, and there was a drain in my side. Everybody came to visit me, mainly out of curiosity. The girls were all anxious to know where I had gotten shot. They had heard all kinds of tales about where the bullet struck. The bolder ones wouldn&#x2019;t even bother to ask: they just snatched the cover off me and looked for themselves. In a few days, the word got around that I was in one piece.<br> <br>On my fourth day in the hospital, I was awakened by a male nurse at about 3 A.M. When he said hello in a very ladyish voice, I thought that he had come to the wrong bed by mistake. After identifying himself, he told me that he had helped Dr. Freeman save my life. The next thing he said, which I didn&#x2019;t understand, had something to do with the hours he had put in working that day. He went on mumbling something about how tired he was and ended up asking me to rub his back. I had already told him that I was grateful to him for helping the doctor save my life. While I rubbed his back above the beltline, he kept pushing my hand down and saying, &#x201c;Lower, like you are really grateful to me.&#x201d; I told him that I was sleepy from the needle a nurse had given me. He asked me to pat his behind. After I had done this, he left.<br> <br>The next day when the fellows came to visit me, I told them about my early-morning visitor. Dunny said he would like to meet him. Tito joked about being able to get a dose of clap in the hospital. The guy with the tired back never showed up again, so the fellows never got a chance to meet him. Some of them were disappointed.<br> <br>After I had been in the hospital for about a week, I was visited by another character. I had noticed a woman visiting one of the patients on the far side of the ward. She was around fifty-five years old, short and fat, and she was wearing old-lady shoes. While I wondered who this woman was, she started across the room in my direction. After she had introduced herself, she told me that she was visiting her son. Her son had been stabbed in the chest with an ice pick by his wife. She said that his left lung had been punctured, but he was doing fine now, and that Jesus was so-o-o good.<br> <br>Her name was Mrs. Ganey, and she lived on 145th Street. She said my getting shot when I did &#x201c;was the work of the Lord.&#x201d; My gang had been stealing sheets and bedspreads off clotheslines for months before I had gotten shot. I asked this godly woman why she thought it was the work of the Lord or Jesus or whoever. She began in a sermonlike tone, saying, &#x201c;Son, people was gitting tired-a y&#x2019;all stealing all dey sheets and spreads.&#x201d; She said that on the night that I had gotten shot, she baited her clothesline with two brand-new bedspreads, turned out all the lights in the apartment, and sat at the kitchen window waiting for us to show.<br> <br>She waited with a double-barreled shotgun.<br> <br>The godly woman said that most of our victims thought that we were winos or dope fiends and that most of them had vowed to kill us. At the end of the sermon, the godly woman said, &#x201c;Thank the Lord I didn&#x2019;t shoot nobody&#x2019;s child.&#x201d; When the godly woman had finally departed, I thought, Thank the Lord for taking her away from my bed.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Later on that night, I was feeling a lot of pain and couldn&#x2019;t get to sleep. A nurse who had heard me moaning and groaning came over and gave me a shot of morphine. Less than twenty minutes later, I was deep into a nightmare.<br> <br>I was back in the fish-and-chips joint, lying on the floor dying. Only, now I was in more pain than before, and there were dozens of Mamas around me jumping up and screaming. I could feel myself dying in a rising pool of blood. The higher the blood rose the more I died.<br> <br>I dreamt about the boy who Rock and big Stoop had thrown off that roof on 149th Street. None of us had stayed around to see him hit the ground, but I just knew that he died in a pool of blood too. I wished that he would stop screaming, and I wished that Mama would stop screaming. I wished they would let me die quietly.<br> <br>As the screams began to die out&#x2014;Mama&#x2019;s and the boy&#x2019;s&#x2014;I began to think about the dilapidated old tenement building that I lived in, the one that still had the words &#x201c;pussy&#x201d; and &#x201c;fuck you&#x201d; on the walls where I had scribbled them years ago. The one where the super, Mr. Lawson, caught my little brother writing some more. Dad said he was going to kill Pimp for writing on that wall, and the way he was beating Pimp with that ironing cord, I thought he would. Mama was crying, I was crying, and Pimp had been crying for a long time. Mama said that he was too young to be beaten like that. She ran out of the house and came back with a cop, who stopped Dad from beating Pimp.<br> <br>I told Pimp not to cry any more, just to wait until I got big: I was going to kill Dad, and he could help me if he wanted to.<br> <br>This was the building where Mr. Lawson had killed a man for peeing in the hall. I remembered being afraid to go downstairs the morning after Mr. Lawson had busted that man&#x2019;s head open with a baseball bat. I could still see blood all over the hall. This was the building where somebody was always shooting out the windows in the hall. They were usually shooting at Johnny D., and they usually missed. This was the building that I loved more than anyplace else in the world. The thought that I would never see this building again scared the hell out of me.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I dreamt about waking up in the middle of the night seven years before and thinking that the Germans or the Japs had come and that the loud noises I heard were bombs falling. Running into Mama&#x2019;s room, I squeezed in between her and Dad at the front window. Thinking that we were watching an air raid, I asked Dad where the sirens were and why the street lights were on. He said, &#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t no air raid&#x2014;just a whole lotta niggers gone fool. And git the hell back in that bed!&#x201d; I went back to bed, but I couldn&#x2019;t go to sleep. The loud screams in the street and the crashing sound of falling plate-glass windows kept me awake for hours. While I listened to the noise, I imagined bombs falling and people running through the streets screaming. I could see mothers running with babies in their arms, grown men running over women and children to save their own lives, and the Japs stabbing babies with bayonets, just like in the movies. I thought, Boy, I sure wish I was out there. I bet the Stinky brothers are out there. Danny and Butch are probably out there having all the fun in the world.<br> <br>The next day, as I was running out of the house without underwear or socks on, I could hear Mama yelling, &#x201c;Boy, come back here and put a hat or something on your head!&#x201d; When I reached the stoop, I was knocked back into the hall by a big man carrying a ham under his coat. While I looked up at him, wondering what was going on, he reached down with one hand and snatched me up, still holding the ham under his coat with his other hand. He stood me up against a wall and ran into the hall with his ham. Before I had a chance to move, other men came running through the hall carrying cases of whiskey, sacks of flour, and cartons of cigarettes. Just as I unglued myself from the wall and started out the door for the second time, I was bowled over again. This time by a cop with a gun in his hand. He never stopped, but after he had gone a couple of yards into the hall, I heard him say, &#x201c;Look out, kid.&#x201d; On the third try, I got out of the building. But I wasn&#x2019;t sure that this was my street. None of the stores had any windows left, and glass was everywhere. It seemed that all the cops in the world were on 145th Street and Eighth Avenue that day. The cops were telling everybody to move on, and everybody was talking about the riot. I went over to a cop and asked him what a riot was. He told me to go on home. The next cop I asked told me that a riot was what had happened the night before. Putting two and two together I decided that a riot was &#x201c;a whole lotta niggers gone fool.&#x201d;<br> <br>I went around the corner to Butch&#x2019;s house. After I convinced him that I was alone, he opened the door. He said that Kid and Danny were in the kitchen. I saw Kid sitting on the floor with his hand stuck way down in a gallon jar of pickled pigs&#x2019; ears. Danny was cooking some bacon at the stove, and Butch was busy hiding stuff. It looked as though these guys had stolen a whole grocery store. While I joined the feast, they took turns telling me about the riot. Danny and Kid hadn&#x2019;t gone home the night before; they were out following the crowds and looting.<br> <br>My only regret was that I had missed the excitement. I said, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we have another riot tonight? Then Butch and me can get in it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Danny said that there were too many cops around to have a riot now. Butch said that they had eaten up all the bread and that he was going to steal some more. I asked if I could come along with him, and he said that I could if I promised to do nothing but watch. I promised, but we both knew that I was lying.<br> <br>When we got to the street, Butch said he wanted to go across the street and look at the pawnshop. I tagged along. Like many of the stores where the rioters had been, the pawnshop had been set afire. The firemen had torn down a sidewall getting at the fire. So Butch and I just walked in where the wall used to be. Everything I picked up was broken or burned or both. My feet kept sinking into the wet furs that had been burned and drenched. The whole place smelled of smoke and was as dirty as a Harlem gutter on a rainy day. The cop out front yelled to us to get out of there. He only had to say it once.<br> <br>After stopping by the seafood joint and stealing some shrimp and oysters, we went to what was left of Mr. Gordon&#x2019;s grocery store. Butch just walked in, picked up a loaf of bread, and walked out. He told me to come on, but I ignored him and went into the grocery store instead. I picked up two loaves of bread and walked out. When I got outside, a cop looked at me, and I ran into a building and through the backyard to Butch&#x2019;s house. Running through the backyard, I lost all the oysters that I had; when I reached Butch&#x2019;s house, I had only two loaves of bread and two shrimp in my pocket.<br> <br>Danny, who was doing most of the cooking, went into the street to steal something to drink. Danny, Butch, and Kid were ten years old, four years older than I. Butch was busy making sandwiches on the floor, and Kid was trying to slice up a loaf of bologna. I had never eaten shrimp, but nobody seemed to care, because they refused to cook it for me. I told Butch that I was going to cook it myself. He said that there was no more lard in the house and that I would need some grease.<br> <br>I looked around the house until I came up with some Vaseline hair pomade. I put the shrimp in the frying pan with the hair grease, waited until they had gotten black and were smoking, then took them out and made a sandwich. A few years later, I found out that shrimp were supposed to be shelled before cooking. I ate half of the sandwich and hated shrimp for years afterward.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>The soft hand tapping on my face to wake me up was Jackie&#x2019;s. She and Della had been to a New Year&#x2019;s Eve party. Jackie wanted to come by the hospital and kiss me at midnight. This was the only time in my life that I ever admitted being glad to see Jackie. I asked them about the party, hoping that they would stay and talk to me for a while. I was afraid that if I went back to sleep, I would have another bad dream.<br> <br>The next thing I knew, a nurse was waking me up for breakfast. I didn&#x2019;t recall saying good night to Jackie and Della, so I must have fallen asleep while they were talking to me. I thought about Sugar, how nice she was, and how she was a real friend. I knew she wanted to be my girl friend, and I liked her a lot. But what would everybody say if I had a buck-toothed girl friend. I remembered Knoxie asking me how I kissed her. That question led to the first fight I&#x2019;d had with Knoxie in years. No, I couldn&#x2019;t let Sugar be my girl. It was hard enough having her as a friend.<br> <br>The next day, I asked the nurse why she hadn&#x2019;t changed my bed linen, and she said because they were evicting me. I had been in the hospital for eleven days, but I wasn&#x2019;t ready to go home. I left the hospital on January 2 and went to a convalescent home in Valhalla, New York. After I had been there for three weeks, the activity director took me aside and told me that I was going to New York City to see a judge and that I might be coming back. The following morning, I left to see that judge, but I never got back to Valhalla.<br> <br>I stood there before Judge Pankin looking solemn and lying like a professional. I thought that he looked too nice to be a judge. A half hour after I had walked into the courtroom, Judge Pankin was telling me that he was sending ...</p><h2>Napoleon Hill&#39;s Keys to Personal Achievement: An Official Publication of The Napoleon Hill Foundation</h2><p><p>An Official Publication of The Napoleon Hill Foundation</p> <p>Think of it!

To comprehend the letter, Porter shows, we must always be aware of the letter-writing and linguistically based rhetorical conventions its author was deploying. &nbsp;The commentary is organized around the five-part epistolary structure that Paul developed for this fundamental letter, a structure that gives shape to its logically unfolding theological argument. Recognizing this structure is vital for interpreting the traditional sections of the body of the letter, as well as for understanding the placement of the problematic chapters 9-11 within Paul's thought. &nbsp;One of the primary means of development Paul uses within the letter is dialogical interaction-what the ancients called diatribe-as a linguistic device for shaping and presenting his argument. Through the insistent questions and responses of the interaction, Paul opens up the major theological issues of the letter-human depravity, sin and works, justification and righteousness, reconciliation, life in the Spirit, and the role of Israel-and shapes the way his addressees should respond to them.</p><p></p><h2>The Mall of Cthulhu</h2><p>A decade ago, college student Laura Harker was saved from a fate worse than death at the hands (and fangs) of a centuries-old vampire priestess and her Satanic minions. Her rescuer, an awkward, geeky folklore student named Teddy, single-handedly slew the undead occupants of the Omega Alpha sorority house, spurred into heroic action by fate itself, inexorably intertwining his and Laura&#x2019;s destinies. <br><br> After navigating her way through law school, Laura is now a junior FBI agent assigned to the Bureau&#x2019;s Boston office. Unfortunately, she finds her job involves more paperwork than adventure. Ted, on the other hand, has spent the past decade perfecting the ultimate latte, and works as a barista in a nearby corporate chain coffeehouse named for a character in Moby Dick. <br><br> When Ted stumbles onto a group of Cthulhu cultists planning to awaken the Old Ones through mystic incantations culled from the fabled Necronomicon, calling forth eldritch horrors into an unsuspecting world, he and Laura must spring into action, traveling from Boston to the seemingly-peaceful suburbs of Providence and beyond, all the way to the sanity-shattering non-Euclidian alleyways and towers of dread R&#x2019;lyeh itself, in order to prevent an innocent shopping center from turning into... The Mall of Cthulhu.</p><p>No BioAt a Delaware university in 1993, geeky folklore student Ted took out a nest of vampires with an axe and a Zippo, saving hot lesbian coed Laura. A decade later, he's still haunted by his supernatural experience, living off the hush money from the university while working as a barista and stalking Laura, now an FBI agent. When Ted learns of a racist cult plotting to bring back the Old Ones, the two friends investigate, and some supernatural shenanigans and carnage ensue. Cooper's characters verge on the whiny and adolescent, but the Lovecraft jibes never quite wear thin. Diehard fans of the short story Call of Cthulhu might not like the unflattering picture of their idol, but those with a passing familiarity will find the pages turning swiftly thanks to the silly action. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nicknamed "tin cans" or "greyhounds," destroyers were fast escort and attack ships that proved indispensable to&nbsp;America's military victories. Beginning with destroyers' first incarnation as torpedo boats in 1874 and ending with World War II, author Clint Johnson shares the riveting stories of the Destroyer Men who fought from inside a "tin can"&#x2014;risking&nbsp;death by cannons, bombs, torpedoes, fire, and drowning.<br> <br> The British invented destroyers, the Japanese improved them, and the Germans failed miserably with them.

Every culture and country has used herbs for their own therapeutic purposes. However, after the development of conventional antibiotics and drugs, the use of herbs has drastically reduced. Most people want quick fix and opt for fast acting medicine, but conventional medicine has its own disadvantage. Aside from being very expensive, it may also contain chemicals and artificial ingredients that are toxic to the body when used for a long time. Herbal medicines, on the other hand, stimulate the body&#x2019;s own defense mechanism, instead of bypassing its natural function. Herbal medicine aims to treat the main cause of the disease instead of just stopping the symptoms. While you might not feel its effect immediately, herbs are also very potent and effective especially if you follow a healthy lifestyle. You can use herbs to prevent and cure almost any disease. All you have to do is to harness its power and use it correctly. Most herbs have rare side effects and are safe to use on a daily basis unlike modern medicine. You can use herbs as a supplement to treat specific illness. While it is usually safe, it is also very important to educate yourself about the correct way to use each herb. This book contains information about the common herbs that you should have in your house. You might be surprised at the health benefits of each of these herbs. The book also contains herbal recipes to make teas and healing salves that you can keep in your medicine cabinet. Overall, using herbs can boost your immunity and help your body cope with mental and physical problems. You can also be creative in thinking of ways to use herbs and make products that will suit your needs.</p><p></p><h2>The TOS Handbook of Texas Birds, Second Edition (Volume 47) (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)</h2><p>&#x201c;. . . includes some stunning images of Mexican and less-well-known Texas species . . . the authors have provided a unique and elegant publication that is truly an important contribution to Texas ornithology.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Great Plains Research</i><br><br>&#x201c;Everyone interested in Texas birds must have the <i>Handbook of Texas Birds</i>, a marvelous book.

In this book she shows you a myriad of additional ways to add nutrients to your diet, reach a personal health goal, or just make good-for-you meals at home. Sweet potato slabs replace toast, cauliflower becomes pizza crust, broccoli turns into tots, avocado gets moussed, jackfruit mimics pulled meat&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s just the beginning. Among the&nbsp; brand-new recipes, complete with nutritional information, you&#x2019;ll find Rainbow Lasagna, Apple French Toast, and Cauliflower Steaks with Chimichurri. Rest assured, Ali still offers up some favorite spiralized dishes, too. Get ready to get your veggies on.</p><p>Combining her deep-rooted love for pasta with her desire for a healthy lifestyle, Ali Maffucci launched Inspiralized.com, the only blog dedicated to cooking creatively and nutritiously with the spiralizer. She is also the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Inspiralized </i>and <i>Inspiralize Everything</i>. She lives in Jersey City, New Jersey, with her husband, Lu.INTRODUCTION <br><br>The question I get asked most is, &#x201c;Do you only eat spiralized food?&#x201d; I am the self-proclaimed biggest proponent and fan of spiralizing, so it&#x2019;s a completely warranted question. <br><br>But let me back up. If you&#x2019;re new to Inspiralized, allow me to introduce myself. (If you&#x2019;re already familiar with Inspiralized and you&#x2019;re flipping through this book wondering why you&#x2019;re seeing non-spiralized recipes, hang tight and I&#x2019;ll explain that, too.) <br><br>In 2013, I quit my corporate job to pursue a dream of building Inspiralized, a healthy brand and community dedicated to cooking with the spiralizer, a kitchen tool that transforms vegetables and fruits into noodles. Inspiralized started off as a food blog, but over these past few years, it&#x2019;s grown to much more than that, including the creation of my own branded spiralizer and the publishing of two cookbooks on the topic. Needless to say, I&#x2019;ve been busy spiralizing for a while now! <br><br>I never get bored of spiralizing&#x2014;not with so many fruits and vegetables that can be spiralized and so many ways to cook spiralized noodles. And I&#x2019;m constantly discovering new produce to use. I recently did pineapple for the first time! But while, yes, I do spiralize almost every single day . . . I <i>don&#x2019;t</i> exclusively eat spiralized food. Cue the gasps! <br><br>What initially drew me to spiralizing was how it unleashed my creative side in the kitchen, where I had previously been in a rut. I felt inspired to transform all my food into something exciting. Every meal could be a magical, inventive piece of art&#x2014;a masterful Bolognese over zucchini noodles or the perfect chicken and carrot noodle soup. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve made a boring meal since!<br><br>Most important, these recipes became integral to my own personal health journey. After launching Inspiralized, my spiralized recipes helped me lose thirty pounds. As someone who had struggled with portion control and weight yo-yoing in the past, I found that spiralizing was a way to have my cake and eat it, too&#x2014;I could eat piping-hot bowls of noodles and still trim my waistline <i>and</i> get in the essential nutrients my body needed to thrive. I loved spiralizing for its health benefits, but also because of its versatility&#x2014;a simple pasta dish could take on dozens of new flavors by simply swapping in a different spiralized vegetable. Talk about ditching the dinner rut!<br><br>After losing the weight, I went into maintenance mode and knew I needed to find more creative ways to cook vegetables to keep up the momentum and to adopt a lifelong healthy lifestyle, not just a diet.<br><br>I started experimenting, and so began the next phase of my healthyeating journey. I looked at every vegetable in the grocery store as something that could be transformed into something else, or incorporated ingeniously into a meal. When I started posting my nonspiralized healthy creations on Instagram, instead of saying, &#x201c;But this isn&#x2019;t spiralized!&#x201d; my followers asked, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the recipe?!&#x201d;<br><br>Bursting at the seams, I could not be more excited (and ready!) to share those meals and recipes with you now. I&#x2019;ve written this cookbook as a direct reflection of how I eat: healthfully and creatively, both spiralized and non-spiralized.<br><br>Say good-bye to your basic steamed veggies forever, and keep reading.

It&#x2019;s a fact. While walking through a kitchenware store, I spotted a doughnut pan and thought, &#x201c;If I stuff these with spiralized veggies, they&#x2019;ll come out looking like bagels!&#x201d; Allow me to introduce you to the spiralized bagel. This cinnamon-raisin version is made with sweet potato noodles and smeared with a vegan cream cheese made from cashews and sweetened with maple syrup. However you top your bagels, you&#x2019;ll love having these in your clean-eating breakfast arsenal.<br><br>Time to Prepare: 15 minutes plus 3 hours soaking <br>Time to Cook: 30 minutes <br>Serves: 6<br><br><b>Ingredients</b><br><i>For the bagels </i><br>Neutral oil or cooking spray <br>1 tablespoon extravirgin olive oil <br>2 sweet potatoes, peeled and spiralized with Blade D <br>2 large eggs, beaten <br>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>1/4 cup raisins<br><br><i>For the maple cashew cream cheese </i><br>1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked for at least 3 hours or preferably overnight <br>3 tablespoons unsweetened almond milk, plus more as needed <br>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract <br>2 teaspoons pure maple syrup <br>Pinch of salt<br><br><b>1.&nbsp;</b>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a nonstick doughnut pan with neutral oil or cooking spray. <br><br><b>2.</b> Make the bagels. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the sweet potato noodles. Cook the noodles, tossing occasionally, until wilted, about 10 minutes. Transfer the noodles to a large bowl and refrigerate until cool, about 5 minutes. <br><br><b>3. </b>Add the eggs, cinnamon, and raisins to the cooled sweet potato noodles and toss well to coat. Pack the noodles into the doughnut pan. Bake until the bagels are firm and the tops are crisp, about 15 minutes. <br><br><b>4.</b> While bagels cook, make the maple cashew cream cheese. In a food processor, process the cashews, almond milk, cinnamon, vanilla, maple syrup, and salt until smooth. If the mixture is too thick to blend, add another tablespoon of almond milk. <br><br><b>5. </b>Carefully pop the bagels out of the pan and let cool for 5 minutes. Spread with the maple cashew cheese and serve.<br><br><b>TIP</b>&nbsp;If you want to make these bagels in your favorite traditional bagel flavor, use russet potatoes, skip the raisins, and season appropriately.<br><br><b>Nutritional Information Per Serving</b><br>Calories 161 / Fat 8g / Sat Fat 2g / Sodium 55mg / Carbs 18g / Fiber 2g / Sugar 8g / Protein 5g</p><h2>Romantic Comedy in Hollywood: From Lubitsch to Sturges</h2><p>In 1934 four movies&#x2014;<i>It Happened One Night, Twentieth Century, The Thin Man,</i> and <i>The Gay Divorcee</i>&#x2014;ushered in the golden age of the Hollywood romantic ("screwball") comedy. Slangy, playful, and "powerfully, glamorously in love with love," the films that followed were unique in their combination of swank and slapstick. Here are the directors&#x2014;Lubitsch (<i>Trouble in Paradise</i>), Capra (<i>It Happened One Night</i>), Hawks (<i>Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday</i>), McCarey (<i>The Awful Truth</i>), La Cava (<i>My Man Godfrey, Stage Door</i>), Sturges (<i>The Lady Eve, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle at Morgan's Creek</i>)&#x2014;and their stars&#x2014;Carole Lombard, Irene Dunne, Cary Grant, Fred Astaire, Clark Gable, Barbara Stanwyck, William Powell, Myrna Loy, among others&#x2014;all described and analyzed in one comprehensive and delightful volume.</p><p>What could top the charm, the outlandishness, the wit, the loveliness of classic Hollywood romantic comedy? The triumph of James Harvey's book is its ability to convey the delights of the genre when it was at its best, during the 1930s and '40s. Though he devotes chapters to major filmmakers such as Frank Capra and Howard Hawks, and stars like Cary Grant, Claudette Colbert, Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers, Harvey's focus is on two of the finest directors of the period: Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges. Harvey describes the joys of watching their movies as he offers many intriguing insights into their cinematic styles and comic techniques. One of the best things about this book is its author's willingness to discuss obscure, hard-to-find films. Of course, he covers popular entertainments such as Lubitsch's <i>Ninotchka</i>, Capra's <i>It Happened One Night</i>, and Sturges's <i>The Lady Eve</i>, but he also devotes equal time to little-known, fascinating works like Sturges's <i>The Great Moment</i> and Lubitsch's <i>Angel</i>. This is an invaluable companion for anyone interested in learning more about two of Hollywood's most wonderful auteurs or about romantic comedy in general. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i><b>James Harvey</b> is a playwright, essayist, critic, and author several books on the movies.

She lives in western Massachusetts.Gr 3-5-Life is never dull for Zoe and Alice. Their mother rescues Great Pyrenees dogs until a new home can be found and their father is a veterinarian. Enormous dogs are always roaming their family's rural home and white fur is always flying everywhere. When the sisters meet their new neighbor, Phillip, they are left with many questions. Phillip has gone silent. What happened that would cause him to stop speaking? Does he believe that he is the cause of his parents' problems? MacLachlan shares with young audiences a touching story of compassion, trust, and patience. She weaves the themes of family and friendship throughout the narrative, peppering her well-paced plot with sufficient tension and avoiding an overdramatization of its climax. Like many of the author's best stories, this one is told simply and gently with touches of light humor. The clear prose, combined with the brevity of the narrative, make the book an ideal selection for young readers, reluctant readers, and animal lovers everywhere. Children will feel satisfied as they discover that both dogs and boys can be rescued, and many will be pleasantly surprised that they can also rescue one another.-Elly Schook, Jamieson Elementary School, Chicago&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Kirk said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A Klingon situation?&#x201d; Lieutenant Rowland echoed. &#x201c;Where, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you asked.&#x201d; Kirk tapped a display on his desk, and a viewscreen on the wall illuminated. He walked over to it. Rowland, no doubt, saw only dots and swirling lines, but the admiral knew what he was looking at. He had been studying it for a week. And Kirk saw trouble.<br> <br>&#x201c;These lines,&#x201d; he said, pointing, &#x201c;indicate the movement of Klingon vessels through this region. All within the past few months.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of lines,&#x201d; Rowland said. Lieutenant Giancarlo Rowland was bright, but young and more than a little green. He was Kirk&#x2019;s flag aide, and since the admiral was desk-bound, that meant Rowland&#x2019;s duties were largely administrative and occasionally ceremonial. Kirk expected that Rowland would distinguish himself in starship duty one of these days, and become a captain before too long. He was young and bright and green, but he was also ambitious, and getting himself linked to an admiral was a wise move, politically speaking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly. Which means a lot of Klingon traffic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do we know why, sir?&#x201d; Rowland asked. A soft southern accent revealed his east Texas roots. &#x201c;I mean, why they&#x2019;re there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Kirk said. &#x201c;Frankly, there&#x2019;s not much there. It&#x2019;s a sparsely populated little corner of the galaxy. There is one inhabited planet in the vicinity&#x2014;but again, sparsely populated. I&#x2019;ve actually been there. It&#x2019;s a Class-M planet, very Earthlike in many respects, but the entire global population can&#x2019;t be more than a few hundred thousand, if that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Capable of warp travel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, maybe I&#x2019;m just bein&#x2019; dense, sir, but I don&#x2019;t see what they could possibly have that Klingons would want.&#x201d;<br> <br>The admiral peered at the chart. He had been asking himself the same question for days. He&#x2019;d been studying every reported Klingon sighting, mapping them, and trying to figure out what their big-picture plan might be. It was easy to simply assume that the Klingons were up to no good, for no other reason than that they were Klingons.<br> <br>That was dangerous thinking, though. Klingons didn&#x2019;t think like humans did. They planned, schemed, and they had reasons for the things they did. If the Klingons were suddenly active in this one particular sector, there was some motivation behind it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, either,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;But we need to find out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk pointed toward Rowland, then back at himself. &#x201c;We. You and me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess we need to go on a little trip.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A little trip?&#x201d; Rowland asked.<br> <br>Kirk returned to his desk and backed out of the chart until it showed a vast swath of the galaxy, with Earth in the lower left corner. The sector under discussion was visible in the upper right.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not next door,&#x201d; Kirk said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Boy, I&#x2019;ll say.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that a problem, Lieutenant?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sir!&#x201d; Rowland said quickly. He stood there, staring at the chart.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there something wrong?&#x201d; Kirk asked after a minute.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sir. It&#x2019;s just . . . well, I&#x2019;ve never been that far out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Most people haven&#x2019;t, Giancarlo. It&#x2019;s a rare privilege. I think you&#x2019;ll like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I usually am,&#x201d; Kirk said with a grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;One more question, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The planet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t have heard of it,&#x201d; Kirk said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called Neural.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Neural?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> <br>Realization dawned in the lieutenant&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been there twice,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You commanded your first planetary survey there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Kirk said again.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were a lieutenant. And, what? My age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About that,&#x201d; Kirk said. Two years younger. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been studying my career.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know everything there is to know, sir. About your career, that is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, everything in Starfleet&#x2019;s records. I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s plenty more that&#x2019;s not in those.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All the best parts,&#x201d; Kirk said. &#x201c;Just the boring stuff goes in the official record.&#x201d; He tapped his temple. &#x201c;The good stuff&#x2019;s in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no doubt, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need a ship,&#x201d; Kirk said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A ship, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To get to Neural. They can&#x2019;t walk here, but we can&#x2019;t walk there, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t&#x2014;we need to take this to the Federation Council, have them raise a protest with the Organians. If the Klingon Empire is in violation of the Treaty&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk cut him off with a wave of his hand. &#x201c;No Federation, no Starfleet. Nothing on the record. Civilian transportation. A charter, since there aren&#x2019;t any commercial flights passing anywhere near there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long story,&#x201d; Kirk said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you sometime. Let&#x2019;s just say I have some unfinished business on Neural. If that is in any way responsible for what&#x2019;s happening there now, with the Klingons, then I need to set things straight if I can. Not Starfleet. Me.&#x201d; He wondered briefly if this was a fool&#x2019;s errand. Second chances were possible, Kirk believed that with all his heart, but they were as rare as snowmen in July. The admiral shook his head to clear it. &#x201c;When I left Neural, I informed Starfleet of the Klingon presence there. The Federation Council raised the issue with the Klingons, and the two sides agreed that Neural fell under the hands-off policy dictated by the Treaty of Organia. If they&#x2019;ve broken that agreement, I want to know about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So a civilian charter . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Something small and fast, preferably. Something that can get in and out of orbit before the Klingons know it&#x2019;s there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pack an extra toothbrush,&#x201d; Kirk suggested. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if they&#x2019;ve invented those yet, and we&#x2019;ll be staying awhile.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d; Kirk sat behind his desk. It was a beautiful thing, carved mahogany with brass fittings, in a vaguely nautical design. It was big and it weighed a ton, and it felt like an anchor chained to his leg. He loved Earth, but like so many things, that love was felt more fervently from a distance. A desk in Starfleet&#x2019;s headquarters had never been one of his career goals. His title, chief of Starfleet Operations, sounded impressive. But to Kirk the title was little more than a cruel joke, since by definition, the chief of Starfleet Operations never operated among the stars.<br> <br>Kirk hadn&#x2019;t realized, until he&#x2019;d decided he had to go back to Neural, how much he missed it. And now that he did realize it, it was all he could think about.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Over the next few days, James Kirk had much to do. Chief of Starfleet Operations was a mouthful of a title, but it wasn&#x2019;t a meaningless one. Starfleet had hundreds of ships and thousands of people assigned to missions all over the galaxy. And one day, hopefully, Kirk thought, outside it. Plenty of people served under him, and although Kirk delegated as much as he could, he was still a busy executive. Before he could leave, the admiral had to make sure the people who reported to him would be able to pick up the slack. Kirk tried to look ahead, to project every major decision he might have to make, and he left instructions as to how he would act. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to compound his mistakes on Neural by letting something important slip by here.<br> <br>Rowland was also busy. Leading a Starfleet star-ship on a multi-year interstellar mission involved a lot of preparation, but when one stepped on board that last time, one knew the ship was fully outfitted, provisioned, and prepared for any eventuality. But a long voyage on a civilian craft was a different matter. While one could hope that the ship was ready for anything, the reality might not match those hopes. Controls and regulations for civilian space travel were strict, but people had been skirting transportation laws since the first hot-rodder had figured out how to remove his car&#x2019;s muffler, if not before.<br> <br>Kirk&#x2019;s last official act was to notify key people about where he was going. Although the trip had to be made without official authorization&#x2014;the phrase &#x201c;plausible deniability&#x201d; had entered bureaucratic lexicon during the mid&#x2013;twentieth century and had not left it since&#x2014;a rear admiral couldn&#x2019;t simply abandon his duties and disappear.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Admiral Elaine Kucera was looking down at a data slate on her desk when Kirk entered, but she was expecting him, so he stood in the doorway until she crooked a finger. &#x201c;Jim,&#x201d; she said, pointing toward a guest chair.<br> <br>He sat. Waited. Finally, Kucera raised her chin and fixed him with gray eyes that he had always found fascinating and just the slightest bit disconcerting. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve considered your request, Jim.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it. Not one little bit. It&#x2019;s risky. It&#x2019;s impulsive. It sounds like something you thought through in about fifteen seconds, while doing two other things.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk didn&#x2019;t like the sound of that. She wouldn&#x2019;t dismiss his proposal without giving him a chance to argue his position, would she? &#x201c;I can assure you, Admiral&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Kucera held her hand up. &#x201c;I said it sounds like that. I understand that it&#x2019;s not. Jim, we&#x2019;ve known each other a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>She stopped him, again. &#x201c;I know how long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly, Kirk was a plebe again, with Cadet Elaine Kucera inspecting his rack.<br> <br>&#x201c;My point is, as outrageous as this seems, on the face of it, I&#x2019;m inclined to go along with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He felt himself relaxing. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you like to know why?&#x201d;<br> <br>What he wanted was to pocket the win and leave. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>She breathed out a long sigh. &#x201c;Do you remember what Gary called you? Back at the Academy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gary Mitchell? He called me a great many things. Most of them aren&#x2019;t repeatable in polite company.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He once said you were a &#x2018;stack of books with legs.&#x2019;?&#x201d; A smile broke, unbidden, on Kucera&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Still cracks me up to think about it. It was so right, so accurate. I knew you&#x2019;d have a great Starfleet career, even then. But I thought it would be in a lab someplace, or one of our think tanks. You didn&#x2019;t strike me as the impulsive type. You were going to be the thinker, the guy who stayed behind and charted courses, or developed policy positions for others to carry out. That&#x2019;s what I thought.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you disappointed?&#x201d; Kirk asked with a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not one little bit. I&#x2019;ve never been so happy to be wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My point is that you confounded my expectations. You know your stuff. But you&#x2019;re not an egghead. You became a captain and then you accomplished real things. Great things. Important ones. Not as theory, but as fact. I don&#x2019;t know if you understand just how rare you are, Rear Admiral James Tiberius Kirk. Starfleet&#x2019;s packed with smart people, and talented and accomplished officers. But we don&#x2019;t have many who combine those traits in exactly the way you do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk wasn&#x2019;t sure how to respond. He was afraid she was working toward denying his request, after all. He had never wanted to be indispensable, because once you were tagged with that, you lost any freedom of movement you might once have had. &#x201c;Admiral&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Those gray eyes bored into him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just us here, Jim. I&#x2019;m still Elaine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right, Elaine. Are we&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying you can go, Jim. I&#x2019;m saying I&#x2019;d hate to lose you and I think your plan&#x2019;s a hare-brained one, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter. Because it&#x2019;s you, and if anybody can pull it off, you can. Also, because I know if I didn&#x2019;t let you do it, you&#x2019;d make me miserable. So yes, fine. You can go, and I&#x2019;ll keep your secret.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Elaine,&#x201d; Kirk said.<br> <br>She placed her palms flat against the desk. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t thank me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Tell me what your backup plan is. I know you have one . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Four days later, during the hour before sunrise, Kirk met Rowland on the beach near Golden Gate Park. Dense fog made the ocean all but invisible, except where the gentle surf pushed water up across the sand. Even the sound seemed muffled, like the steady, calm, throbbing heartbeat of the planet. Kirk had always liked the park, especially this end of it, with its wild tangles of trees and underbrush. He was glad the city had maintained it; although it had suffered during the Eugenics Wars, since then it had been restored to its original glory, and it remained a landmark for tourists and locals alike.<br> <br>On this early morning, the beach was empty. Kirk and Rowland waited quietly, dressed in civilian clothing thanks to the journey&#x2019;s unofficial nature. Each held a duffel containing changes of clothing and other personal items, as well as Starfleet-issued phasers and communicators. When Rowland suggested the park meeting point, Kirk had been surprised. &#x201c;I thought we&#x2019;d be picked up at a spaceport,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;They have transporter technology?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Captain Cook is a decommissioned Starfleet vessel,&#x201d; Rowland explained. &#x201c;They have transporters. I thought that was a priority.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll certainly make it easier to get to Neural,&#x201d; Kirk replied. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll only have to enter its orbit long enough to beam us down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Givin&#x2019; the Klingons considerably less time to spot the ship,&#x201d; Rowland said. &#x201c;That was my thinkin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good job, Mister Rowland.&#x201d; Kirk studied his aide as they waited. The kid was resourceful; anticipating his commanding officer&#x2019;s needs would serve him well in his Starfleet career.<br> <br>Rowland was tall and lanky, with a long neck and huge hands. His hair was a dirty blond, with a hairline that was already receding. He had quick, green eyes that seemed to miss nothing, a jaw that could have been carved from granite, and a nose that was almost flat at the top but then angled out toward the end. He had a pretty girlfriend named Shonna, whom Kirk had met, a civilian who worked in the city. Rowland wanted to marry her but was torn about the timing. Should he do it before he was assigned a berth on a starship, an assignment that could take him away for five years? Or wait until after, when he might have worked his way up through the ranks and be assured of a planetside post? Kirk had told him, &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t regret marrying her, even if you have to go away. But you might regret not doing it when you had the chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since offering that small slice of wisdom, Kirk had informed Rowland that they were leaving on a secret mission of unknown duration. Rowland couldn&#x2019;t tell Shonna where he was going, or when he&#x2019;d be back, and they hadn&#x2019;t had time to marry.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are we waiting for?&#x201d; Kirk asked after a while.<br> <br>&#x201c;Them,&#x201d; Rowland said, tilting his head toward the park.<br> <br>Kirk peered through the mist and saw two people walking their way, also in civilian clothes and carrying duffel bags of their own. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Security personnel. Apryl Burch and Titus Hay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Security? Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, you&#x2019;re a Starfleet admiral. You can get away with almost anything you want. But that doesn&#x2019;t include goin&#x2019; to a strange, potentially dangerous planet without a security detachment. Command was very clear about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told them no,&#x201d; Kirk said.<br> <br>&#x201c;They told me that under no circumstances could you make this trip without &#x2019;em. They wanted to send six, but I talked them down to two.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you didn&#x2019;t tell me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Orders.

By 1986, negotiations involved senior government officials, intelligence agents, and the African National Congress. For the next four years, they assembled in places such as a gamepark lodge, the Palace Hotel in Lucerne, Switzerland, a fishing hideaway, and even in a hospital room. All the while, De Klerk's campaign assured white constituents nothing would change. Sparks shows how the key players, who began with little reason to trust one another, developed friendships which would later play a crucial role in South Africa's struggle to end apartheid.<br> <br> "A gripping, fast-paced, authoritative account of the long and mostly secret negotiations that brought South Africa's bitter conflict to its near-miraculous end. Sparks's description of these talks sometimes brings a lump to one's throat. He shows how the participants' deep mutual suspicion was gradually replaced by excitement at the prospect of making a momentous agreement&#x2014;and also by the dawning realization that the people on the other side were human beings, perhaps even decent human beings."&#x2014;Adam Hochschild, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br> <br> "A splendid and original history. . . .

Tomorrow Is Another Country tells the story of the behind-the-scenes collaborations that started in 1985 with an astonishing series of secret jailhouse meetings between Kobie Coetsee, then minister of justice, and his prisoner, Nelson Mandela. Within a year clandestine negotiations involved senior government officials, intelligence agents, and representatives of the outlawed African National Congress; they met secretly in a hospital room, the Palace Hotel in Lucerne, Switzerland, a fishing hideaway, even a gamepark lodge.

Inside the slow-motion movements of tai chi is a sophisticated mind/body/spirit practice. Derived from the I Ching (Book of Changes), bagua is unique in its circular movements, spiraling energy, and unpredictable changes of direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frantzis begins with an overview of both bagua and tai chi and their origins in Chinese culture, followed by comprehensive advice on how to incorporate these practices into daily Western life. Written in an easy, conversational style, the book provides an explanation of an art that is practiced by millions in China to release&nbsp;stress and maintain a vigorous level of health. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the 2.3 million Americans who currently practice tai chi report improved sleep, conditioning, and overall wellness. <i>Bagua and Tai Chi </i>offers a gentle healing and strengthening system that will appeal to a wide audience, including martial artists, meditators, dancers and athletes, personal trainers, and anyone looking to reduce stress and increase calmness and clarity through an effective, low-impact body practice.</p><p>By the time he was 18 years old, Bruce Frantzis had earned black belts in karate, judo, jujitsu, iaido, and aikido. He has trained over 10,000 students in tai chi, bagua, qigong, breathing, and other Taoist energy arts. He lives in San Anselmo, CA."Bruce Frantzis is the successor and inheritor of Lao Tse's Water method of Taoist meditation passed down by his teacher, Liu Hung Chieh. Frantzis presents a uniquely experiential approach to the <i>I Ching</i>&nbsp;as a living manual on how change manifests at all levels of existence. Frantzis' ability to communicate his comprehensive understanding of the health, fighting and meditation aspects of bagua allows the student to experience in body, mind and spirit the profound embodied wisdom of the <i>I Ching</i>'s spiritual vision." &#x2014;Alan Peatfield, PhD, Lecturer in Archaeology at University College Dublin, Ireland<br><br>"While martial arts was initially founded in self-defense, it has proved an avenue to the calm that we all seek. <i>Bagua and Tai Chi: Exploring the Potential of Chi, Martial Arts, Meditation, and the I Ching </i>is a study of these disciplines, as Bruce Frantzis relays the teachings from Lineage Master Liu Hung in how to use Tai Chi and Bagua to embrace greater health, clear one's mind, find relaxation, and even how to use it for defensive purposes. <i>Bagua and Tai Chi </i>is an intriguing pick for those who enjoy the martial arts for any self-improvement purposes." &#x2014;<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Building Architectural Models</h2><p>Whether you intend to add flair to your office presentation or charm to your model train set, this book will give you professional insight into designing and producing architectural models--with truly spectacular results.

As we stepped through the portal into the barrows near Elqaneve, the Elfin City, the brilliance of the night sky hit me, untainted by the light pollution running rampant in Earthside cities. Over there, even in the country, the stars sparkled more faintly, muted and dim. But here . . . I stared up at the heavens, stunned.</p><p>Had I really been away long enough for me to forget how beautiful my home world was? And yet . . . and yet . . . the Earthside city lights that watched over the nighttime landscape called to me. The hustle and bustle of Seattle had worked its way under my skin, and I wasn&#x2019;t so sure I wanted to return home for good, even should we be offered the chance.</p><p>We arrived in Otherworld just shy of seven P.M., and the darkness of the spring evening was spiraling over the sky. My sisters were relieved to see the chill weather begin to break, but I preferred winter, when the sun set earlier and rose later. During summer, the long sleep of daylight claimed too much of my time. But the wheel must turn, and now spring held sway. The vernal equinox was due in a week, and along with it, my promise ceremony with Nerissa.</p><p>We still hadn&#x2019;t settled on details for the ceremony, and time was running short. As was my girlfriend&#x2019;s temper. It irked her that I couldn&#x2019;t come up with ideas for a concrete plan. My continual stream of &#x201c;whatever you want&#x201d; was wearing thin, but the truth was, I had no clue what I wanted. When Dredge had turned me into a vampire, I&#x2019;d let go all hope and plans for love and weddings, and now I couldn&#x2019;t remember what I had dreamed about before I&#x2019;d lost my life.</p><p>But thoughts of Nerissa and home and rituals drifted to the back of my mind as Trenyth approached. The advisor to Queen Asteria, he was meeting us to escort us back to the palace in the center of the Elfin city.</p><p>&#x201c;About time he got here. I&#x2019;m freezing.&#x201d; Delilah mumbled as she blew on her fingers.</p><p>Camille jabbed her in the ribs with an elbow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m cold, too, but be nice. He probably got held up by something important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t hear me from over there.&#x201d; Delilah glared at her, then shrugged and jammed her hands in the pockets of her jeans.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bet on it. Elves have extremely sensitive hearing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up, both of you. Whining about the cold won&#x2019;t do anything to warm you up.&#x201d; I felt a little guilty barking at them. After all, I was immune to the chill. Vampires didn&#x2019;t feel much in the way of weather changes unless it was extreme, one way or the other. I knew my sisters and our escorts were freezing, but I didn&#x2019;t want Trenyth&#x2019;s feelings hurt.</p><p>We&#x2019;d divided up the manpower, making some of the guys stay home. Accompanying us were Trillian, one of Camille&#x2019;s husbands; Shade, Delilah&#x2019;s half-dragon fianc�; Chase, the human detective with a touch of elf in his background; Rozurial, an incubus; and Vanzir, a demon who worked with us. That left us with a fighting contingent, but still enough manpower over Earthside to protect the house. And protecting our home there was an absolute necessity, especially now that Iris and Bruce were back from their honeymoon, and Iris was pregnant.</p><p>Trenyth looked tired, and for the first time, I noticed a few tiny age lines around his eyes. Elves seldom showed their age. Time passed for them differently, leaving them untouched and unperturbed. And most exhibited a patience that defied understanding. Unlike some of the more volatile denizens of Otherworld, that Elfin quality seemed to grow with the centuries.</p><p>Standing medium height, Trenyth was thin but not gaunt, was elegant to a fault, and carried himself with a regal air. Decorum incarnate, his manner wasn&#x2019;t a fa�ade, as it was with some members of the royal courts.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome back to Elqaneve, girls.&#x201d; He sounded rushed and kept glancing back at the carriages behind him.</p><p>&#x201c;Trenyth!&#x201d; Delilah apparently had forgiven him for letting us stand out in the cold. She stepped forward to give him a hug.</p><p>Trenyth blushed lightly, awkwardly returning the embrace. &#x201c;Delilah, blessings to you and your house.&#x201d; He turned to Camille and held out his hands. &#x201c;And you, my lady. How are you doing?&#x201d; A look of concern washed over his face as she took them and pressed them to her heart for a moment before letting go.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you . . .&#x201d; His words slipped away.</p><p>Camille ducked her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to take a while, but I&#x2019;m making progress. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll ever be the same. You can&#x2019;t be, not after something like that. But it helps that Hyto is dead and that I saw him die.&#x201d; Her smile turned to ice. Camille had become harsher since her ordeal, darker in nature, but it seemed to suit the transitions through which she was going.</p><p>&#x201c;Camille&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I said quietly. &#x201c;What she went through with Hyto . . . what I went through with Dredge, traumas like that change you forever. But it doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t find happiness, or grow stronger than before.&#x201d; Life had a way of forcing you to either take charge or knuckle under, and neither my sisters nor I were the knuckling kind.</p><p>Trenyth nodded. &#x201c;And the two of you have gone above and beyond what I&#x2019;d expect of anybody, under the circumstances. Now, come, please. We have much to discuss&#x2014;events are transpiring that you must know about. And although spring is on the way, the night is still cold and the carriages are waiting for us.&#x201d;</p><p>And, quick as a cat, we were tucked into the carriages with blankets spread over our laps and heading toward the castle of Queen Asteria.</p><p>Elqaneve was a city of cobblestoned streets that wound through beautiful gardens, surrounding low-rising houses. Windows glimmered, illuminated by the soft glow of lanterns. The town was simultaneously elegant and cozy, and while I appreciated its beauty, it felt too gentle for me. Though perhaps <i>gentle</i> wasn&#x2019;t the right word. Elves weren&#x2019;t gentle. They could be dangerous and terrifying when roused. No, perhaps the word I was looking for was <i>subtle</i>.</p><p>The Elfin race wasn&#x2019;t known for being in your face, and that&#x2019;s exactly the type of person I was. I hadn&#x2019;t always been like this&#x2014;<i>take no prisoners, my way or the highway</i>. I&#x2019;d been a loner when I was younger, and only in the past twelve or thirteen Earthside years had I turned into the fury that I could become.</p><p>When I&#x2019;d become a vampire, I&#x2019;d come out of my shell . . . once I managed to climb back into my mind. Sanity had been sporadic for the first year&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t remember much from that year&#x2014;and it had taken the Otherworld Intelligence Agency a lot of patience and training to teach me how to function in society, and not turn into the monster Dredge had planned for me to become.</p><p>I glanced over at Camille. She seemed lost in thought, gazing out the window, leaning her head against the side of the carriage. Trillian sat next to her, holding her hand, stroking it lightly with one finger. The jet black of his skin glowed against her pale cream, and for a moment I thought I saw a swirl of silver race from his fingers to hers.</p><p>Chase sat next to me, and he, too, stared quietly out the window. Delilah, Shade, Rozurial, and Vanzir were with Trenyth, in the carriage behind us.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, you get lost somewhere in there?&#x201d; I spoke softly, but Camille&#x2019;s eyes flickered and she shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;No, not really. I&#x2019;m just wondering what Queen Asteria wants to see us about.&#x201d;</p><p>She was lying. I knew it. Most likely, she was thinking about our father. It was hard not to, now that we were back in Otherworld. He&#x2019;d disowned her, and as a result, we&#x2019;d disowned him. Everything was convoluted into a horrible mess, compounded by his lack of sensitivity. At this point, we could probably qualify for an Otherworld episode of <i>The Jerry Springer Show</i>. No doubt <i>that</i> would thrill Delilah to pieces, as long as the ringmaster himself hosted it.</p><p>With another look at her face, I let the subject drop. We&#x2019;d hashed and rehashed the family drama to the point of no return. It was moot. Father didn&#x2019;t approve of Camille&#x2019;s choice in husbands&#x2014;Trillian in specific&#x2014;nor her pledging herself as priestess to Aeval&#x2019;s Court. But she&#x2019;d had no choice. Love doesn&#x2019;t always give you a choice, and neither do the gods.</p><p>As a result, we had said &#x201c;buh-bye&#x201d; to both Dear Daddy and the Otherworld Intelligence Agency, and now we worked for Queen Asteria.</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you think Queen Asteria summoned us? And why ask me to come along? I almost never interact with her&#x2014;that&#x2019;s more yours and Delilah&#x2019;s department.&#x201d; Being able to come out only after dusk had its drawbacks.</p><p>&#x201c;I was wondering why she asked me to come along, too.&#x201d; Chase frowned.</p><p>&#x201c;You are a distant relative of hers, you know.&#x201d; I gave him a poke in the ribs, careful not to shove too hard. Sometimes I forgot how freakishly strong I&#x2019;d become. It was easy to hurt my friends and family if I wasn&#x2019;t careful.</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t track. She made it a point to invite me, and I doubt familial bliss has anything to do with it.&#x201d; He played with the buttons on his new blazer, fastening and unfastening the bottom one until I thought he was going to rip it off. &#x201c;You really like my new jacket?&#x201d;</p><p>Camille and I exchanged looks. This had to be the twentieth time that he&#x2019;d asked since we started out for the portal at home.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s nice.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t good with diplomacy, but Chase was nervous and I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt his feelings. Unfortunately, the pseudo-military look didn&#x2019;t suit him at all. However, since Sharah&#x2014;his elfin girlfriend and the future mother of his child&#x2014;had given him the blazer, he was better off pretending he liked it. Humans had <i>nothing</i> on the elves or the Fae when it came to pregnancy-hormonal mood swings. It was in his interests of self-preservation to lie to her.</p><p>But that didn&#x2019;t mean I couldn&#x2019;t needle him. &#x201c;So tell us, in the privacy of the carriage, you really think you can rock that look?&#x201d; I grinned at him. His expression when he was under fire was priceless. And by now he knew when I was serious and when I was just blowing smoke. Though it <i>had</i> been more fun when I could scare the crap out of him just by tickling his neck.</p><p>He squirmed. &#x201c;Do <i>not </i>do this to me, Menolly. Don&#x2019;t put me on the spot.&#x201d; But his eyes twinkled and he laughed. &#x201c;Only you would force me into a corner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I only torture the people I love.&#x201d; With a snort, I folded my arms and leaned back in my seat. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t answer. I can tell you don&#x2019;t feel comfortable in it. But we promise we won&#x2019;t tell Sharah. Or her aunt. <i>The Queen</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>That sparked another ripple of fear in his expression. Queen Asteria happened to be the aunt of his girlfriend. And therefore, the great-aunt of his child. I had to admit, I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be caught up in the web of politics Chase was facing.</p><p>Another thought struck me. &#x201c;Does Asteria even <i>know</i> Sharah&#x2019;s pregnant?&#x201d;</p><p>Camille swiveled her head, glancing at Chase. &#x201c;<i>She doesn&#x2019;t</i>, does she? You&#x2019;d better come clean, because you don&#x2019;t want us saying something stupid to her.&#x201d;</p><p>Chase shifted uncomfortably. &#x201c;Um, well . . . the truth is . . . <i>no</i>. She doesn&#x2019;t know. Sharah wanted to wait. We haven&#x2019;t decided what we&#x2019;re going to do yet. I&#x2019;ve asked her to marry me, but she turned me down.&#x201d; He sounded morose. &#x201c;She said we aren&#x2019;t ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You <i>aren&#x2019;t</i> ready.&#x201d; I stared at him. &#x201c;You know that. She knows that. Why rush it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s carrying my child&#x2014;&#x201d; He paused, then let out a long sigh. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m thinking about it from Earthside morality. I&#x2019;d be a scumbag if she wanted to get married and I said <i>no</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t asking you, though. And she&#x2019;s not cutting you out of the baby&#x2019;s life, either.&#x201d; I cocked my head. &#x201c;Wait. She hasn&#x2019;t cut you out, <i>has</i> she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not that. Sharah said I can be as much a part of the baby&#x2019;s life as I want.&#x201d; He looked so uncomfortable that I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what the root of the problem was.</p><p>&#x201c;So tell me again what&#x2019;s the problem? You in love with her?&#x201d;</p><p>He blushed this time and Camille broke in softly. &#x201c;Perhaps the issue is that Sharah offended him by insinuating he might not want to participate.&#x201d;</p><p>Chase shifted in his seat, and glowered. &#x201c;Exactly! <i>I&#x2019;m not my father. I&#x2019;m no deadbeat and I&#x2019;m not going to vanish on my kid</i>. And since she&#x2019;s choosing to have the baby, I damned well plan on being there to make sure the child knows his&#x2014;or her&#x2014;heritage.&#x201d;</p><p>The words poured out so fiercely that at first I thought he might be pissed, but the hurt that flashed across his face spoke volumes. Chase was afraid someone would even <i>think</i> he might consider abandoning his child. He couldn&#x2019;t take being seen as a carbon copy of his missing father&#x2014;the father he&#x2019;d never known. His childhood had left him with deep emotional scars. The situation with Sharah must be triggering fears and resentments from his own past.</p><p>I sheathed my fangs. &#x201c;We know you&#x2019;d never abandon your child, Chase. And Sharah knows that, too. Nobody who knows you would ever think you&#x2019;d bail.&#x201d;</p><p>I was about to reach over and pat his hand but stopped. I simply wasn&#x2019;t the comforting type, and he knew it. I opted for catching his gaze and holding it. I silently focused on him, willing him to relax. It wasn&#x2019;t polite to use Fae glamour on our friends, but sometimes we chose to do what was necessary over what was ethically correct.</p><p>After a moment he relaxed, breathing softly, and leaned his head back against the rocking carriage.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m unaware of what you just did,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;But thank you. Delilah knows that Sharah hasn&#x2019;t told anyone yet, so she won&#x2019;t say anything, either. We talked about it last night on the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>Chase and our sister Delilah had been involved in what was a downward spiral of a relationship. Now, they were both with other people, both a lot happier, <i>and</i>they&#x2019;d saved their friendship.</p><p>At that moment the carriage shifted and Camille peered out into the evening street. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re nearing the palace.&#x201d; She smoothed her skirts and pulled out a compact, peeking into the mirror to make sure her makeup was set.</p><p>&#x201c;Me, too?&#x201d; Not for the first time, I wished I could check my own damned makeup, but that wasn&#x2019;t ever going to be a reality, so I sucked it up and asked for help. She leaned close, brushing my face with a quick sweep of powder.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re good to go. You look great.&#x201d; She winked. &#x201c;Not that the Queen&#x2019;s going to care, but . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it isn&#x2019;t politic to visit royalty looking like a slob.&#x201d; The carriage lurched to a stop and the door opened, the driver reaching in to help us down. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;d better see what bad news is in store for us now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even want to know.&#x201d; Camille flashed me a wry grin as the driver put his hands on her waist and swung her down from the carriage step to the rain-slicked path below. &#x201c;But I guess we don&#x2019;t have a choice.&#x201d;</p><p>Once Delilah and the others stood next to us, Trenyth led us into the palace to meet the Elfin Queen.</p><p>Overhead, the stars glimmered. They were beautiful, but all I ever saw were the stars and the moon and clouds against the night sky. Sometimes it seemed like sunlight had become a myth&#x2014;a dream I&#x2019;d once had, a dream that was beautiful but fleeting. For me, only the starlight existed.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The palace of the Elfin Que...</p></p><h2>Lotus 72 - 1970 onwards (all marks): An insight into the design, engineering, maintenance and operation of Lotus&#39;s legendary Formula 1 car (Owners&#39; Workshop Manual)</h2><p><p>Conceived by Colin Chapman, the Lotus 72 is one of the most successful Formula 1 cars ever made.

His life was a ceaseless artistic quest, and he channeled much of his wide-ranging intellect and ferocious wit into his letters. Punctuated by exasperated theorizing and philosophical reflection, outbursts of creative ecstasy and melancholic confession, the artist&#x2019;s correspondence reveals both the heroic and all-toohuman qualities of a man who is indisputably among the pantheon of all-time greats.<br><br> This new translation of C�zanne&#x2019;s letters includes more than twenty that were previously unpublished and reproduces the sketches and caricatures with which C�zanne occasionally illustrated his words.

She said her mouth was dry, that she was &#x201c;drink- ing water all the time&#x201d; and was compelled to rise three to four times each night to pass her urine. She felt &#x201c;weak and tired.&#x201d; Her appetite was variable; the bowels constipated and she had a dizzy headache. Belching of gas, a tight feeling in the abdomen, and a &#x201c;burning&#x201d; in the stomach followed her meals. She was short of breath."&nbsp;--Elliott Joslin&#x2019;s diabetes &#x201c;case no. 1,&#x201d; as recorded in the case notes of his clinic.<br><br> Elliott Joslin was a medical student at Harvard in the summer of 1893, working as a clinical clerk at Massachusetts General Hos- pital, when he documented his rst consultation with a diabetic <br> patient. He was still a good three decades removed from becom- ing the most in uential diabetes specialist of the twentieth century. The patient was Mary Higgins, a young immigrant who had arrived from Ireland ve years previously and had been working as a domestic in a Boston suburb. She had &#x201c;a severe form of diabetes mellitus,&#x201d; Joslin noted, and her kidneys were already &#x201c;succumbing to the strain put upon them&#x201d; by the disease. <br><br> Joslin&#x2019;s interest in diabetes dated to his undergraduate days at Yale, but it may have been Higgins who catalyzed his obsession. Over the next ve years, Joslin and Reginald Fitz, a renowned Har- vard pathologist, would comb through the &#x201c;hundreds of volumes&#x201d; of handwritten case notes of the Massachusetts General Hospital, looking for information that might shed light on the cause of the disease and perhaps suggest how to treat it. Joslin would travel twice to Europe, visiting medical centers in Germany and Austria, to learn from the most in uential diabetes experts of the era.&nbsp; <br>In 1898, the same year Joslin established his private practice to specialize in the treatment of diabetics, he and Fitz presented their analysis of the Mass General case notes at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association in Denver. They had exam- ined the record of every patient treated at the hospital since 1824. What they saw, although they didn&#x2019;t recognize it at the time, was the beginning of an epidemic. <br><br> Among the forty-eight thousand patients treated in that time period, a year shy of three-quarters of a century, a total of 172 had been diagnosed with diabetes. These patients represented only 0.3 percent of all cases at Mass General, but Joslin and Fitz detected a clear trend in the admissions: the number of patients with diabetes and the percentage of patients with diabetes had both been increasing steadily. As many diabetics were admitted to Mass General in the thirteen years after 1885 as in the sixty-one years prior. Joslin and Fitz considered several explanations, but they rejected the possibility that the disease itself was becoming more common. Instead, they attributed the increase in diabetic patients to a &#x201c;wholesome tendency of diabetics to place themselves under careful medical supervision.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t that more Bosto- nians were succumbing to diabetes year to year, they said, but that a greater proportion of those who did were taking themselves off to the hospital for treatment. <br><br> By January 1921, when Joslin published an article about his clinical experience with diabetes for The Journal of the American Medical Association, his opinion had changed considerably. He was no longer talking about the wholesome tendencies of diabetics to&nbsp;seek medical help, but was using the word &#x201c;epidemic&#x201d; to describe what he was witnessing. &#x201c;On the broad street of a certain peaceful New England village there once stood three houses side by side,&#x201d; he wrote, apparently talking about his hometown of Oxford, Massachusetts. &#x201c;Into these three houses moved in succession four women and three men&#x2014;heads of families&#x2014;and of this number all but one subsequently succumbed to diabetes.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br>Joslin suggested that had these deaths been caused by an infec- tious disease&#x2014;scarlet fever, perhaps, or typhoid, or tuberculosis&#x2014; the local and state health departments would have mobilized investigative teams to establish the vectors of the disease and prevent further spread. &#x201c;Consider the measures,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;that would have been adopted to discover the source of the outbreak and to prevent a recurrence.&#x201d; Because diabetes was a chronic dis- ease, not an infectious one, and because the deaths occurred over years and not in the span of a few weeks or months, they passed unnoticed. &#x201c;Even the insurance companies,&#x201d; Joslin wrote, &#x201c;failed to grasp their significance.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>*<br>We&#x2019;ve grown accustomed, if not inured, to reading about the ongoing epidemic of obesity. Fifty years ago, one in eight American adults was obese; today the number is greater than one in three. The World Health Organization reports that obesity rates have doubled worldwide since 1980; in 2014, more than half a billion adults on the planet were obese, and more than forty million children under the age of ve were overweight or obese. Without doubt we&#x2019;ve been getting fatter, a trend that can be traced back in the United States to the nineteenth century, but the epidemic of diabetes is a more intriguing, more telling phenomenon. <br><br> Diabetes was not a new diagnosis at the tail end of the nine- teenth century when Joslin did his rst accounting, rare as the disease might have been then. As far back as the sixth century b.c., Sushruta, a Hindu physician, had described the characteristic&nbsp;sweet urine of diabetes mellitus, and noted that it was most common in the overweight and the gluttonous. By the rst century a.d., the disease may have already been known as &#x201c;diabetes&#x201d;&#x2014;a Greek term meaning &#x201c;siphon&#x201d; or &#x201c; owing through&#x201d;&#x2014;when Aretaeus of Cappodocia described its ultimate course if allowed to proceed untreated: &#x201c;The patient does not survive long when it is completely established, for the marasmus [emaciation] produced is rapid, and death speedy. Life too is odious and painful, the thirst is ungov- ernable, and the copious potations are more than equaled by the profuse urinary discharge. . . . If he stop for a very brief period, and leave off drinking, the mouth becomes parched, the body dry; the bowels seem on re, he is wretched and uneasy, and soon dies, tormented with burning thirst.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>Through the mid-nineteenth century, diabetes remained a rare af iction, to be discussed in medical texts and journal articles but rarely seen by physicians in their practices. As late as 1797, the British army surgeon John Rollo could publish &#x201c;An Account of Two Cases of the Diabetes Mellitus,&#x201d; a seminal paper in the history of the disease, and report that he had seen these cases nineteen years apart despite, as Rollo wrote, spending the intervening years &#x201c;observ[ing] an extensive range of disease in America, the West Indies, and in England.&#x201d; If the mortality records from Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century are any indication, the city&#x2019;s resi- dents were as likely to die from diabetes, or at least to have diabetes attributed as the cause of their death, as they were to be murdered or to die from anthrax, hysteria, starvation, or lethargy.<br><br> In 1890, Robert Saundby, a former president of the Edinburgh Royal Medical Society, presented a series of lectures on diabetes to the Royal College of Physicians in London in which he estimated&nbsp; <br>that less than one in every fty thousand died from the disease. Diabetes, said Saundby, is &#x201c;one of those rarer diseases&#x201d; that can only be studied by physicians who live in &#x201c;great cent[er]s of popula- tion and have the extensive practice of a large hospital from which to draw their cases.&#x201d; Saundby did note, though, that the mortality rate from diabetes was rising throughout England, in Paris, and even in New York. (At the same time, one Los Angeles physician, according to Saundby, reported &#x201c;in seven years&#x2019; practice he had not met with a single case.&#x201d;) &#x201c;The truth,&#x201d; Saundby said, &#x201c;is that diabe- tes is getting to be a common disease in certain classes, especially the wealthier commercial classes.&#x201d; <br><br>William Osler, the legendary Canadian physician often described as the &#x201c;father of modern medicine,&#x201d; also documented both the rarity and the rising tide of diabetes in the numerous editions of his seminal textbook, <i>The Principles and Practice of Medicine</i>. Osler joined the staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Bal- timore when the institution opened in 1889. In the first edition of his textbook, published three years later, Osler reported that, of the thirty- ve thousand patients under treatment at the hospital since its inception, only ten had been diagnosed with diabetes. In the next eight years, 156 cases were diagnosed. Mortality statistics, wrote Osler, suggested an exponential increase in those reportedly dying from the disease&#x2014;nearly doubling between 1870 and 1890 and then more than doubling again by 1900. <br><br> By the late 1920s, Joslin&#x2019;s epidemic of diabetes had become the subject of newspaper and magazine articles, while researchers in the United States and Europe were working to quantify accurately the prevalence of the disease, in a way that might allow meaningful comparisons to be drawn from year to year and decade to decade. In Copenhagen, for instance, the number of diabetics treated in the city&#x2019;s hospitals increased from ten in 1890 to 608 in 1924&#x2014;a sixty-fold increase. When the New York City health commissioner Haven Emerson and his colleague Louise Larimore published an&nbsp; <br>analysis of diabetes mortality statistics in 1924, they reported a 400 percent increase in some American cities since 1900&#x2014;almost 1,500 percent since the Civil War. <br><br> Despite all this, the disease remained a relatively rare one. When Joslin, working with Louis Dublin and Herbert Marks, both statis- ticians with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, examined the existing evidence in 1934, he again concluded that diabetes was rapidly becoming a common disease, but only by the stan- dards of the day. He conservatively estimated&#x2014;based on what he considered careful studies done in New York, Massachusetts, and elsewhere&#x2014;that only two to three Americans in every thousand had diabetes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>The Art of Helping: Student Workbook</h2><p>This product has some writing on approximately 10 pages, the rest are unmarked and book is in very good condition</p><p>Dr. Robert R. Carkhuff believes that all human growth and development begins with relating. Dr. Carkhuff considers himself fortunate to have begun his own career in helping and human relations. He was the first to define the interpersonal core of all helping and human relationships in operational, and therefore achievable, terms. The so-called Carkhuff model is specifically the source of all current systematic approaches to interpersonal relating and, indeed, is generally the source of human resource development approaches. Indeed, it is precisely this theme of Human Development that defines Carkhuff s lifework. It begins with the most profound step: relating interpersonally. It culminates in a series of spiraling explosions: empowering people to actu alize their own human potential. It is in the context of this ongoing work that this ninth edition of The Art of Helping is presented!</p><h2>I&#x2019;m Just Going Down To The Pub To Do A Few Miracles</h2><p>In this a reprint of a much sought after classic, join Colin Bloy in his ground-breaking discoveries, which lead to a rational way of spiritual healing.

Monstrosities in the real world bred monsters in paintings and sculpture, on film, and in the pages of journals and artists' books. <br>Despite the political and personal turmoil brought on by the Spanish Civil War and World War II, avant-garde artists in Europe and those who sought refuge in the United States pushed themselves to create some of the most potent and striking images of the Surrealist movement. Trailblazing essays by four experts in the field trace the experimental and international extent of Surrealist art during these years--and, perhaps most unexpectedly of all, its irrepressible beauty.</p><p><b>Oliver Tostmann </b>is Susan Morse Hilles Curator of European Art at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Conn.

Only a few months ago, she was just another poor Irish housemaid from Five Points; now, she&#x2019;s learning to shoot a gun and dance the waltz and throw a grown man over her shoulder. Better still, she&#x2019;s been recruited to the special branch, an elite unit dedicated to cases of a paranormal nature, and that means spending her days alongside the dashing Thomas Wiltshire.</p><p>But being a Pinkerton isn&#x2019;t quite what Rose imagined, and not everyone welcomes her into the fold. Meanwhile, her old friends aren&#x2019;t sure what to make of the new Rose, and even Thomas seems to be having second thoughts about his junior partner. So when a chilling new case arrives on Rose&#x2019;s doorstep, she jumps at the chance to prove herself &#x2013; only to realize that the stakes are higher than she could have imagined. Six delegates have been murdered at a local political convention, and the police have no idea who&#x2013;or what&#x2013;is responsible. One thing seems clear: The killer&#x2019;s next target is a candidate for New York City mayor, one Theodore Roosevelt.</p><p>Convinced that something supernatural is afoot, Rose and Thomas must track down the murderer before Roosevelt is taken out of the race&#x2013;permanently. But this killer is unlike any they&#x2019;ve faced before, and hunting him down will take them from brownstones to ballrooms to Bowery saloons. Not quite comfortable anywhere, Rose must come to terms with her own changed place in society&#x2013;and the fact that some would do anything to see her gone from it entirely.</p></p><p>ERIN LINDSEY has lived and worked in dozens of countries around the world, but has only ever called two places home: her native city of Calgary and her adopted hometown of New York.

Twenty years later, Min returns to the story of her own life to give us the next chapter, an immigrant story that takes her from the shocking deprivations of her homeland to the sudden bounty of the promised land of America, without language, money, or a clear path. </p><p>It is a hard and lonely road. She teaches herself English by watching Sesame Street, keeps herself afloat working five jobs at once, lives in unheated rooms, suffers rape, collapses from exhaustion, marries poorly and divorces.But she also gives birth to her daughter, Lauryann, who will inspire her and finally root her in her new country. Min's eventual successes-her writing career, a daughter at Stanford, a second husband she loves-are remarkable, but it is her struggle throughout toward genuine selfhood that elevates this dramatic, classic immigrant story to something powerfully universal.</p></p><p><b>Anchee Min</b> was born in Shanghai in 1957. At seventeen she was sent to a labor collective, where a talent scout for Madame Mao's Shanghai Film Studio recruited her to work as a movie actress. She moved to the United States in 1984. Her first memoir, <i>Red Azalea</i>, was an international bestseller, published in twenty countries. She has since published six novels, most recently <i>Pearl of China</i>.*Starred Review* Min&#x2019;s first book, Red Azalea (1994), was an electrifying memoir. Six singular novels followed, including Becoming Madame Mao (2000) and Pearl of China (2010). Now Min returns to her own astonishing life story. She writes, as always, with singeing candor and devastating precision as she chronicles the severe poverty and brutality of her childhood in Shanghai, her grim years in a labor camp, and her friendship with the girl who became the actress Joan Chen and helped Min immigrate to the U.S. But Min&#x2019;s ordeal was far from over when she arrived in Chicago to attend art school. With no English and no money, she lived in constant fear of deportation while contending with the shock of American racism, exploitative jobs, wretched living conditions, criminal scams, crushing loneliness, illness, even rape. Her brief marriage turned into a living hell when they naively purchase a dilapidated apartment building. But Min gave birth to her daughter and started writing in English, an extraordinary and resounding creative breakthrough that finally set her free. Min&#x2019;s indomitable and magnificent memoir spans the full spectrum of the human experience, elucidates her noble mission as a writer, and portrays a woman of formidable strength and conviction. &#x201c;I was broken yet standing determinedly erect. I could be crushed, but I would not be conquered.&#x201d; --Donna Seaman</p><h2>The American Revolution 1774-1783</h2><p>The American Revolution has been characterized politically as a united political uprising of the American colonies and militarily as a guerrilla campaign of colonists against the inflexible British military establishment. Daniel Marston argues that this belief, though widespread, is a misconception. He contends that the American Revolution, in reality, created deep political divisions in the population of the Thirteen Colonies, while militarily pitting veterans of the Seven Years&#39; War against one another, in a conflict that combined guerrilla tactics and classic eighteenth century campaign techniques on both sides. The peace treaty of 1783 that brought an END to the war marked the formal beginning of the United States of America as an independent political entity.</p><p>This unique series studies every major war in history looking at all the aspects of war, from how it felt to be a soldier to the lasting impact of the conflict on the world around it.Daniel Marston completed both his BA and MA in History at McGill University, Montreal, Canada and his DPhil in the History of War at Balliol College, Oxford.

Things for the baby, attic treasures. You&#x2019;re welcome to use any of it.&#x201d; </p><p>Confused, but eager to please her, I undid the flaps and opened the carton. Withdrawing a crinkled ball of newsprint, I carefully unfurled the paper until a child&#x2019;s cup emerged. &#x201c;Pretty!&#x201d; Easy to be enthusiastic about such a solid piece of china, the limpid-eyed bunny painted on the side. The child I was making could one day hold this cup in his or her hands, would never know what it was like to come into a world without Beatrix Potter china, and look, stuffed among the wrapped baby dishes&#x2014;a green sweater with a cheerful button-eyed polar bear sewn onto its belly. Already I knew my baby would be far luckier than I had ever been.</p><p>&#x201c;The cups were from my mother.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;One for each child?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We could have used help with the rent, but she sent us china and silver spoons. That&#x2019;s Geraldine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I love them.&#x201d; I was breathless at the thought of having a mother who provided such bounty.</p><p>&#x201c;We had to buy each child on layaway,&#x201d; Shirley said. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t pay the doctor or the hospital. But she sent bunting. For the crib we couldn&#x2019;t afford. And christening gowns. You can imagine how well those went over with Stanley.&#x201d; Her laugh was not a happy one.</p><p>Whatever Shirley disliked about her mother had to be small change compared to what I&#x2019;d grown up with, I thought. I wanted Shirley&#x2019;s baby cups, and the silver spoons, and the bunting if she offered it, and the clothes her four babies had worn. I wanted things, for I had never had them. I pulled a piece of newsprint off a cereal bowl, straightened it out, laid it on the table. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s this? Missing student?&#x201d;</p><p>She peered at the photo. &#x201c;Oh my, that&#x2019;s from a dozen years ago at least.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>PAULA WELDEN MISSING SINCE SUNDAY FROM</b></p><p><b>COLLEGE CAMPUS: SEARCH IS MADE OVER WIDE</b></p><p><b>AREA: GIRL&#x2019;S FATHER ARRIVES HERE FROM HIS</b></p><p><b>STAMFORD HOME; WHEN LAST SEEN MISSING</b></p><p><b>STUDENT WAS WEARING RED PARKA , BLUE JEANS</b></p><p><b>AND THICK- SOLED SNEAKERS</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eighteen years, in fact. &#x201c;She looks like you, Rose, doesn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; </p><p>A hole in the fabric of one day and entry to another.

She was from elegant Stamford, Connecticut&#x2014;a far cry from South Philly&#x2014;and her father came up to aid in the search. He must have loved her. If I had seen Paula Welden&#x2019;s picture, knowing nothing else, I would have wanted to be like her.</p><p>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; said Shirley softly.

Born in Berlin into a prosperous Jewish family, he made a precarious living as a literary journalist, championing the drama of Bertolt Brecht and translating the work of Baudelaire and Proust. He is most famous for his essays `The Task of the Translator&#39; (1923) and `The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&#39; (1936).

At the popular level, Acts is more often mined for answers to contemporary debates than heard for its natural inflections. Instead of using Acts as a prooftext, Alan Thompson brings a biblical-theological framework to the account to expose Luke&#39;s major themes as they relate to the book as a whole. With this framework in place, Thompson argues that Acts is an account of the &#39;continuing story&#39; of God&#39;s saving purposes. Consequently we find that Luke wants to be read in light of the Old Testament promises and the continuing reign of Christ in the inaugurated kingdom. Read in this way as a snapshot of God&#39;s dynamic, unfolding kingdom, the book of Acts begins to regain the deep relevance it had in the first century.</p><p>Alan J. Thompson (PhD, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School), has been teaching New Testament and Biblical Theology at Sydney Missionary &amp; Bible College, Australia since 2005. He is the author of <i>One Lord, One People: The Unity of the Church in Acts in Its Literary Setting </i>(LNTS), <i>The Acts of the Risen Lord Jesus: Luke's Account of God's Unfolding Plan&nbsp;</i>(NSBT), and <i>Luke</i> (EGGNT)."No one should teach or preach from the Acts of the Apostles again without first reading this book." (Douglas S. Huffman, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, Spring 2013)<br><br>"This is a very helpful book which I have read with great appreciation.

(Steve Walton, Evangelical Quarterly, 86.2 (2014))<br><br>"We can be grateful to Thompson for a profound, convincing, and delightful work on the theology of Acts. It is a much needed work, for there are few theologies of Acts written, and I can't think of one that is more accessible and faithful." (Thomas R. Schreiner, Themelios, November 2011, 36.3)<br><br>"This book will help readers further appreciate the organic and progressive nature of revelation and understand the narrative flow and canonical function of the book of Acts.

Loved and hated, revered and reviled, during his lifetime he served as a lightning rod for dispute. Few major figures in American history provoked such a polarization of public opinion. One supporter described him as the possessor of "an enlightened mind and superior wisdom; the adorer of our God; the patriot of his country; and the friend and benefactor of the whole human race." Martha Washington, however, considered Jefferson "one of the most detestable of mankind"--and she was not alone.</p> <p>While Jefferson&#x2019;s supporters organized festivals in his honor where they praised him in speeches and songs, his detractors portrayed him as a dilettante and demagogue, double-faced and dangerously radical, an atheist and "Anti-Christ" hostile to Christianity. Characterizing his beliefs as un-American, they tarred him with the extremism of the French Revolution. Yet his allies cheered his contributions to the American Revolution, unmasking him as the now formerly anonymous author of the words that had helped to define America in the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson, meanwhile, anxiously monitored the development of his image. As president he even clipped expressions of praise and scorn from newspapers, pasting them in his personal scrapbooks.</p> <p>In this fascinating new book, historian Robert M. S. McDonald explores how Jefferson, a man with a manner so mild some described it as meek, emerged as such a divisive figure. Bridging the gap between high politics and popular opinion, Confounding Father exposes how Jefferson&#x2019;s bifurcated image took shape both as a product of his own creation and in response to factors beyond his control. McDonald tells a gripping, sometimes poignant story of disagreements over issues and ideology as well as contested conceptions of the rules of politics. In the first fifty years of independence, Americans&#x2019; views of Jefferson revealed much about their conflicting views of the purpose and promise of America.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jeffersonian America</p><p></p></p><p><p>Robert M.

Instead, Dr. McDonald writes, Jefferson actually believed that in a republic, the true leader does not seek leadership or power, preferring the private life unless the public demands and confers such honors as political authority....

StoryCorps founder Dave Isay draws from ten years of the revolutionary oral history project&#x2019;s rich archives, collecting conversations that celebrate the power of the human bond and capture the moment at which individuals become family. Between blood relations, friends, coworkers, and neighbors, in the most trying circumstances and in the unlikeliest of places, enduring connections are formed and lives are forever changed.<br><br> The stories shared in <i>Ties That Bind </i>reveal our need to reach out, to support, and to share life&#x2019;s burdens and joys. We meet two brothers, separately cast out by their parents, who reconnect and rebuild a new family around each other. We encounter unexpected joy: A gay woman reveals to her beloved granddaughter that she grew up believing that family was a happiness she would never be able to experience. We witness lifechanging friendship: An Iraq war veteran recalls his wartime bond with two local children and how his relationship with his wife helped him overcome the trauma of losing them.<br><br> Against unspeakable odds, at their most desperate moments, the individuals we meet in <i>Ties That Bind </i>find their way to one another, discovering hope and healing. Commemorating ten years of StoryCorps, the conversations collected in <i>Ties That Bind</i> are a testament to the transformational power of listening.</p><p><b>DAVE ISAY </b>is the founder of StoryCorps and the recipient of numerous broadcasting honors, including six Peabody awards and a MacArthur &#x201c;Genius&#x201d; Fellowship. He is the author/editor of numerous books that grew out of his public radio documentary work, including three StoryCorps books:<i> Listening Is an Act of Love </i>(2007), <i>Mom: A Celebration of Mothers from StoryCorps </i>(2010), and<i> All There Is: Love Stories from StoryCorps </i>(2012)&#x2014;all <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers.&nbsp;Dave is also an Executive Producer of StoryCorps Animated Shorts, as seen on the PBS documentary series, <i>POV. </i>StoryCorps' first-ever animated special,<i> Listening Is an Act of Love</i>,<i> </i>premiered last Thanksgiving on PBS.<b>Introduction </b><br><br>On October 23, 2003, the legendary oral historian Studs Terkel, ninety-one years old at the time, stood in front of a small sound studio aglow in the middle of Grand Central Terminal. &#x201c;Today we shall begin celebrating the lives of the uncelebrated!&#x201d; he said, pointing at our first recording booth. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in Grand Central Terminal. We know there was an architect, but who hung the iron? Who were the brick masons? Who swept the floors? These are the noncelebrated people of our country. In this kiosk, those anonymous people&#x2014;the noncelebrated&#x2014;will speak of their lives!&#x201d;<br><br>Ten years and almost fifty thousand interviews later, StoryCorps stands as the largest collection of noncelebrated voices ever gathered in history&#x2014;indeed, it stands as the larg�est collection of <i>any</i> voices ever gathered in history: almost one hundred thousand participants, recorded in more than a thousand locations and in all fifty states; eighteen terabytes of data, with hundreds of stories broadcast across the nation and around the world.<br><br>StoryCorps started out as a simple, if somewhat crazy, idea: build a soundproof booth where you can interview the most important person in your life with the help of a trained facilitator. The interview is structured to encourage people to dig deep&#x2014;many think of it as &#x201c;If I had forty minutes left to live what would I ask this person who means so much to me?&#x201d; At the end of each session, the participants walk away with a CD copy of their interview, and StoryCorps sends another copy to the Library of Congress, where it becomes part of America&#x2019;s history. Someday, the great-great-great�grandchildren of StoryCorps participants will get the chance to meet their ancestors through this recording.<br><br>StoryCorps was built on a series of basic ideas I&#x2019;d come to embrace in my twenties and thirties while working as a docu�mentary radio producer: that a microphone gives people the license to ask questions of others that they wouldn&#x2019;t normally ask, and that being listened to reminds people how much their lives matter. StoryCorps is based on the belief that we can discover the most profound and exquisite poetry in the words and stories of the noncelebrated people around us, if we just have the courage to ask meaningful questions and the patience to listen closely to the answers.<br><br>Many of these ideas began taking shape for me twenty-five years ago, just after I&#x2019;d graduated from college. In 1988, I was twenty-two years old and about to start medical school, when I was lucky enough to fall into public radio completely by accident. One afternoon I walked into a small shop on New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side owned by a married couple&#x2014; both recovering heroin addicts with HIV&#x2014;who told me about their dream of building a full-scale museum dedicated to stories of addiction before they died. While their task was clearly impossible, their spirits were remarkable. When I got home, I called every TV and radio station in the yellow pages to try to convince them to do a story about the pair. No one was the least bit interested&#x2014;until I got to the news director of a local community radio station, a woman named Amy Goodman. She told me that it sounded like a good idea, but that she didn&#x2019;t have anyone available at the station to cover it. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you do it yourself?&#x201d; she asked. So I took a re�corder and interviewed the couple at their shop. When the story was aired on the station the next evening, a producer from NPR in Washington, DC, happened to be driving through town, heard the piece, and picked it up for national broadcast. I promptly withdrew from medical school to start down this new path. I had found my calling.<br><br>A few months before recording that story, I had also ac�cidentally discovered that my father was gay. He and my mother had been married&#x2014;extremely happily, I thought&#x2014; for twenty-five years, and the revelation came as a shock. I was having a tough time dealing with the news&#x2014;and with my dad. Once I started working in public radio, though, I thought I might be able to begin making sense of it all with a microphone and tape recorder. I wanted to understand more about my father and what his life had been like, but I wasn&#x2019;t ready to hear it from him.<br><br>One day my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots. I&#x2019;d never heard of them, but I was intrigued and decided to learn more. I found out that in 1969, the police raided Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Manhattan&#x2019;s Greenwich Village, and, with billy clubs drawn, they tried to shut it down. This was a common occurrence in gay bars all across New York City at that time&#x2014;but on a series of nights that June, the patrons fought back. Nothing like it had ever happened before, and it sparked the modern gay rights movement in this country.<br><br>I decided to set off with a tape recorder to track down everyone I could find who might help me understand the riots, and what life was like for gay people in the years before. The microphone gave me the freedom to go places, meet peo�ple, and ask questions that otherwise would have felt com�pletely out of bounds.<br><br>In New York&#x2019;s East Village, I found an elderly gay woman named Jheri living in senior housing just a few blocks from my apartment, who helped me understand the soul-numbing shame, fear, and abuse that ran rampant in the years before Stonewall. I met tough old Irish bartenders who exploded all of my preconceived notions of gay men. And I met Sylvia Rivera, who, as an eighteen-year-old drag queen and street kid, fought valiantly and viciously on the nights of the riots. No matter how many times she was clobbered with batons, she kept coming back for more. She was heroic and historic&#x2014; today many consider her the Rosa Parks of the gay rights movement. Sylvia was the bravest and toughest person I had ever met.<br><br>These conversations turned my world upside down, and gave me a feeling of deep connection to a culture I&#x2019;d known nothing about. By airing the program on public radio, I hoped the documentary might do the same for others. While there were some bumps along the way&#x2014;I remember calling an arts editor of a New York tabloid and asking if she&#x2019;d write a story about the documentary, since it was the first one ever made about the riots. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t believe in homosexuality here&#x201d;&#x2014;the outpouring of response to the pro�gram was all I could have hoped for and more. I dedicated the documentary to my dad. We&#x2019;d found common ground once again. It changed our relationship, and it changed my life.<br><br>I would go on to produce scores of radio documentaries about people living on the margins of society over the next fifteen years. I came to believe even more deeply in the les�sons I learned from my Stonewall experience about the inti�macy and immediacy of radio, the power of the human voice to transcend differences and divides, and the ability of a radio story to hit like an adrenalin shot to the heart when honestly and authentically told. I also saw, again and again, how affirming it was for people to be listened to, especially those who felt most silenced by the rest of society. Over the course of an interview I could see people&#x2019;s backs stretch and straighten&#x2014;I would literally watch the experience make them stand taller.<br><br>The people I interviewed in those years&#x2014;living in hous�ing projects and forgotten small towns, working in hospitals and prisons, serving coffee at luncheonette counters, surviving in hospices and homeless shelters&#x2014;inspired and moved me. They were some of the most powerful and important stories I could imagine&#x2014;lives defined by courage, character, and con�viction. People whose spirits could not be broken and whose sense of humor and hope never wavered. Time and again at the end of an interview, I&#x2019;d have the same conversation:<br><br>&#x201c;Have you ever told your story before?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?<br><br>&#x201c;No one ever asked.&#x201d;<br><br>Out of these and myriad other experiences and influences, I decided to undertake the fairly radical experiment of StoryCorps. Having seen the positive impact that participat�ing in documentary work could have on people&#x2019;s lives, I wanted to open the experience to everyone. I hoped to create a project that was all about giving people the chance to inter�view one another, with only a secondary emphasis on editing stories for broadcast. In essence, StoryCorps flipped the pur�pose of traditional documentary work from an artistic or edu�cational project created for the benefit of an audience into an experience principally focused on enhancing the lives of those recording the interviews.<br><br>Once StoryCorps opened, it quickly became clear that the idea was going to work. Participants told us that the forty minutes they spent in the booth were among the most impor�tant of their lives. People would sit down in front of the mi�crophone and begin to weep even before the session began. In every interview, participants took the chance to talk about parts of their lives they had never discussed before. When participants passed away, we heard from family members that the CDs had become a cherished and singular record of their loved ones&#x2019; voice, life, and spirit.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure when we launched StoryCorps whether we&#x2019;d find any stories appropriate for radio broadcast coming out of these recording sessions&#x2014;but I was wrong. We soon started editing brief audio segments from a handful of the interviews and airing them on public radio. We consider every interview session equally valuable and a potentially sacred moment in participants&#x2019; lives, but we came to realize that some record�ings had a universal quality that made them appropriate to share with a larger audience. We also realized that some of the interviews translated powerfully to the printed page&#x2014; though not necessarily the same ones that worked on the radio&#x2014;and started compiling our first StoryCorps book, <i>Lis�tening Is an Act of Love</i>.<br><br>I think of StoryCorps as being in the wisdom collection business, and I have had the privilege over the past decade of immersing myself in the truths and life lessons that spring from the stories we record. Listening to the experiences of regular people living life to its fullest and exemplifying hu�manity at its finest has, time and again, stirred my soul and strengthened my faith in this nation and its people.<br><br>I think of Lynn Weaver, who recorded a StoryCorps in�terview about his father, Ted Weaver, in 2007 at the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center in Atlanta. Ted worked as a janitor in pre-civil-rights Knoxville, Tennessee. In Lynn&#x2019;s interview, which appears on page 172 of this book, he remembers a time he was struggling with high school algebra&#x2014;and how one night his father stayed up until 4 a.m. teaching himself algebra from Lynn&#x2019;s textbook, so that he could in turn teach his son.<br><br>I was fortunate to be at a reception at the King Center where we listened to some of the stories recorded there, in�cluding Lynn Weaver&#x2019;s tribute to his dad. The next day, I re�ceived this e-mail:<br><br><i>Mr. Isay, </i><br><br><i>You will never know how honored and touched I was by the playing of the remembrance of my dad. After I got home, I realized that the evening of the StoryCorps reception was the anniversary of my father&#x2019;s death. Even in death, he continues to embrace me with his love. This project has touched me more than you will ever know. </i><br><br><i>Lynn Weaver, chairman of surgery, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA </i><br><br>After you read Lynn&#x2019;s story, you&#x2019;ll understand why I think his father, Ted&#x2014;a janitor from Knoxville, Tennessee&#x2014;is the kind of man we should be building statues to and nam�ing bridges after. He exemplifies America at its very best. The lessons we can all learn from a life like his are timeless and sacred.<br><br>This past decade&#x2019;s journey has been the most exhausting and exhilarating of my life. So much about StoryCorps goes against the grain of what can feel like a celebrity-choked cul�ture. There were more than a few instances over the past ten years, especially when struggling to raise the money needed to keep StoryCorps afloat, that I&#x2019;d think, <i>This isn&#x2019;t going to work, the whole idea is just nuts&#x2014;maybe it&#x2019;s time to give it up!</i> But then I&#x2019;d remember the small devoted army of facilitators fanned out across the country working tirelessly to lift up the voices of everyday people. Or our production team would walk into my office to play that week&#x2019;s NPR broadcast, and the truth and power of the story coming out of the speakers would jolt me back into reality.<br><br>Six months ago my seventy-eight-year-old dad, who seemed like the type to live to one hundred, was diagnosed with cancer. Nine days later, he died. His doctor later de�scribed his illness as &#x201c;a violent tornado that came out of no�where and left total destruction in its wake.&#x201d; At 3:00 a.m. on the day after he passed, I listened for the first time to the StoryCorps interview we recorded together several years ear�lier. I had thought I couldn&#x2019;t believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I already did, but hearing his voice speak to me from my computer twenty hours after his death, alone in my dark living room, knowing this was the way my two young children were going to get to know this man who meant so much to me&#x2014;that was the moment the rubber hit the road, and I fully felt the significance of the work we&#x2019;ve been doing.<br><br>The small team that launched StoryCorps in 2003 has now grown to become a staff of more than a hundred. We&#x2019;ve recorded interviews in thousands of places&#x2014;in cities, towns, and hamlets, and everywhere from a remote Alaskan fish�ing village to the White House. We&#x2019;ve launched nine national initiatives, including StoryCorps Griot (a griot is a West Afri�can storyteller), which today stands as the largest collection of African American voices ever gathered. Our latest en�deavor, StoryCorpsU, is a yearlong curriculum for high-needs schools that uses StoryCorps stories and teaches the StoryCorps interviewing method in order to help young people feel more connected to their teachers and each other, and help them recognize how much their lives matter. Early research shows the program&#x2019;s enormous potential for moti�vating, engaging, and inspiring kids at some of the toughest schools in the country.<br><br>But our work has really only just begun. It&#x2019;s our dream that someday the StoryCorps interview method and the sto�ries that we distill from these interviews will be woven into the fabric of American life and the lives of all Americans; that StoryCorps will grow into a sustaining national institution that reminds people that every life and every story matters equally. We hope, one day, to help foster an American culture that is a little more just and tolerant and that strives always to respect and nurture human dignity.<br><br>As I see it, one of the most important reasons to record a StoryCorps interview, and certainly the reason closest to my heart, is to honor the person or people to whom you feel most grateful. That person who stood by you during your darkest days, who recognized something special in you when no one else did; the person who rescued you or guided you or sustained you with their kindness, generosity, and strength of character. The family member, friend, teacher, neighbor, colleague&#x2014;sometimes even stranger&#x2014;with whom you feel a connection so powerful that the relationship can take on a sacred quality. These are the stories in <i>Ties That Bind&#x2014;</i>a book of gratitude to mark the tenth anniversary of an undertaking built on human connection and kindness. Mother Teresa used to say, &#x201c;We have forgotten that we belong to each other.&#x201d; This is a book that helps us to remember.<br><br>I hope that this collection&#x2014;and every experience you&#x2019;ve had or will have with StoryCorps&#x2014;will do for you what it&#x2019;s done for me: that it will remind you it&#x2019;s never too early to say the important things to the people ...</p><h2>The Middleman: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>One of <i>The Boston Globe</i>&#x2019;s Best Mysteries of the Year</b><br><b></b><br><b>&#x201c;A thought-provoking political thriller, a dark story for dark times.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p>With <i>The Middleman</i>, the perfect thriller for our tumultuous, uneasy time, Olen Steinhauer, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of ten novels, including <i>The Tourist </i>and <i>The Cairo Affair</i>, delivers a compelling portrait of a nation on the edge of revolution, and the deepest motives of the men and women on the opposite sides of the divide. </p><p>One day in the early summer of 2017, about four hundred people disappear from their lives.

Rachel Botsman, Roo Rogers</h2><p>In the 20th century humanity consumed products faster than ever, but this way of living is no longer sustainable. This new and important book shows how technological advances are driving forms of &#39;collaborative consumption&#39; which will change forever the ways in which we interact both with businesses and with each other. The average lawn mower is used for four hours a year. The average power drill is used for only twenty minutes in its entire lifespan. The average car is unused for 22 hours a day, and even when it is being used there are normally three empty seats. Surely there must be a way to get the benefit out of things like mowers, drills and even cars, without having to carry the huge up-front costs of ownership? There is indeed. Collaborative consumption is not just a buzzword, it is a new win-win way of life. This insightful and thought-provoking new book by Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers is an important and fast-moving survey of the dramatic changes we are seeing in the way we consume products. Many of us are familiar with freecycle, eBay, couchsurfing and Zipcar. But these are just the beginning of a new phenomenon. Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers have interviewed business leaders and opinion formers around the world to draw together the many strands of Collaborative Consumption into a coherent and challenging argument to show that the way we did business and consumerism in the 20th century is not the way we will do it in the 21st century.</p><p><p>WHAT&#x2019;S MINE IS YOURS is about Collaborative Consumption, a new, emerging economy made possible by online social networks and fueled by increasing cost consciousness and environmental necessity. Collaborative Consumption occurs when people participate in organized sharing, bartering, trading, renting, swapping, and collectives to get the same pleasures of ownership with reduced personal cost and burden, and lower environmental impact. </p><p>The book addresses three growing models of Collaborative Consumption: Product Service Systems, Communal Economies, and Redistribution Markets. The first, Product Service Systems, reflects the increasing number of people from all different backgrounds and across ages who are buying into the idea of using the service of the product-what it does for them-without owning it. Examples include Zipcar and Ziploc, and these companies are disrupting traditional industries based on models of individual ownership. Second, in what the authors define as Communal Economies, there is a growing realization that as individual consumers, we have relatively little in the way of bargaining power with corporations. A crowd of consumers, however, introduces a different, empowering dynamic. Online networks are bringing people together again and making them more willing to leverage the proverbial power of numbers. Examples of this second category include Etsy, an online market for handcrafts, or the social lending marketplace Zopa. The third model is Redistribution Markets, exemplified by worldwide networks such as Freecycle and Ebay as well as emerging forms of modern day bartering and &#x201c;swap trading&#x201d; such as Zwaggle, Swaptree, and Zunafish. Social networks facilitate consumer-to-consumer marketplaces that redistribute goods from where they are not needed to somewhere or someone where they are. This business model encourages reusing/reselling of old items rather them throwing them out, thereby reducing the waste and carbon emissions that go along with new production.</p><p>WHAT&#x2019;S MINE IS YOURS describes how these three models come together to form a new economy of more sustainable consumerism. Collaborative Consumption started as a trend in conjunction with the emergence of shared collective content/information sites such as Wikipedia and Flickr and with the recent economic troubles and increasing environmental awareness, it is growing into an international movement. The authors predict it will be a fully fledged economy within the next five years.</p><p>In this book the authors travel among the quiet revolutionaries (consumers and companies) from all around the world. They explore how businesses will both prosper and fail in this environment, and, in particular, they examine how it has the potential to help create the mass sustainable change in consumer behaviors this planet so desperately needs. The authors themselves are environmentalists, but they are also entrepreneurs, parents, and optimistic citizens. This is a good news book about long-term positive change.</p><p></p>Rachel writes, consults, and speaks on the power of collaboration and sharing, and on how it can transform the way we live.

Jessie and her three siblings, including actress Glenn Close, spent many years in the Moral Re-Armament cult. Jessie passed her childhood in New York, Switzerland, Connecticut, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), and finally Los Angeles, where her life quickly became unmanageable. She was just fifteen years old.<br><br>Jessie's emerging mental illness led her into a life of addictions, five failed marriages, and to the brink of suicide. She fought to raise her children despite her ever worsening mental conditions and under the strain of damaged romantic relationships. Her sister Glenn and certain members of their family tried to be supportive throughout the ups and downs, and Glenn's vignettes in RESILIENCE provide an alternate perspective on Jessie's life as it began to spiral out of control. Jessie was devastated to discover that mental illness was passed on to her son Calen, but getting him help at long last helped Jessie to heal as well. Eleven years later, Jessie is a productive member of society and a supportive daughter, mother, sister, and grandmother. <br><br>In RESILIENCE, Jessie dives into the dark and dangerous shadows of mental illness without shying away from its horror and turmoil. With <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and Pulitzer Prize finalist Pete Earley, she tells of finally discovering the treatment she needs and, with the encouragement of her sister and others, the emotional fortitude to bring herself back from the edge.</p><p>Jessie Close is an internationally recognized speaker, author, poet and advocate for mental health reform. She lives with bipolar disorder in the foothills of the Tobacco Root Mountains outside Bozeman, Montana with her Service Dog, Snitz, and three other dogs. She is the author of <em>The Warping of Al</em>, (Harper &amp; Row 1990) and she writes a regular blog for Bring Change 2 Mind, an anti-stigma organization that her sister, Glenn, created at Jessie's request. <br><br>Jessie has received awards from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the largest grassroots mental health organization in America with more than 600,000 members, and Mental Health America, the largest grassroots group of persons living with mental disorders. She also has received the Jed Foundation Award and The McLean Award. Along with her son, Calen, Jessie is a much sought-after inspirational speaker.<br>"She has lived a life that even at her worst was spellbinding, and it's a definitely-worth-the-read memoir."&#x2015;<b><i><em>USA Today</em></i></b><br><br>"It's obvious that this is no ordinary memoir...hard to put down...Close is telling her story to the world in hopes of removing the stigma from mental illness. It's a story well worth reading."&#x2015;<b><i><em>BookPage</em></i></b><br><br>"Her memoir tells of all this in frank, gritty detail."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Maclean's</em></i></b></p><h2>How It All Began: The Personal Account of a West German Urban Guerrilla</h2><p><p><i>How It All Began </i>is the personal testimony of Michael "Bommi" Baumann, a man who, in the late 1960s and early &#x2019;70s, was a member of the June 2nd Movement, one of the most spectacular urban guerrilla organizations in West Berlin.</p><p>Of this book, Baumann said: "Others should understand why people take the road of armed struggle, how they come to it, how the seeds are planted, and what the emotions behind it are, what kind of considerations and psychic preconditions are needed to overcome the fear involved."</p><p>But Baumann, ultimately, had to make a choice. He renounced violence when he left the June 2nd Movement in 1972.</p><p>Security police seized the original German edition, <i>Wie Alles Anfing</i>, when it appeared in 1975. The resulting trial and publicity raised an international outcry and the book ended up being republished in German and translated into six languages.</p><p>In an age when public protests&#x2014;against corporate greed, against free trade agreements, and for social justice&#x2014;are becoming more frequent and more violent, <i>How It All Began </i>provides a fascinating glimpse into the thinking behind urban struggle, and the consequences of action.</p><p>As Baumann himself said, "Violence is a perfectly adequate means, I never had any hangups about it."</p><p>The first English version of <i>How It All Began </i>was published by Arsenal in 1977 and updated in 1981. Long out of print, it has been re-issued, making it available to readers once again.</p><p><b>Bommi Baumann </b>was a leading member of the June 2nd Movement, one of the most active urban guerrilla groups in West Berlin.

Soup is one of the staple foods in a Jesuit community, and there is almost always a pot simmering on the stove. In more than forty years as a Jesuit brother, Brother Curry has traveled the world, lived in many different communities, and prepared many, many pots of soup. This collection includes recipes for sixty of his most popular soups-everything from an exotic Roasted Red Pepper Soup to the classic Minestrone Milanese to a hearty Corn Chowder, from a relatively simple chicken soup to the more complex Mussels Soup Billy-bi. But Brother Curry writes about a great deal more than soup. He includes stories to savor about his life in the community of Jesuits: the people he&#39;s met; the meals he&#39;s enjoyed; and the daily practices of patience, reverence, humility, and care that go into making a good soup and a good life.</p><p>Brother Rick Curry, S.J., author of <b>The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking</b>, is the founder and artistic director of the National Theater Workshop for the Handicapped. He is also an actor, a teacher, and a master breadmaker.Brother Curry's second cookbook is a natural companion volume to his first, The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking. He presents 60 recipes for soups from a variety of cuisines, both simple and more elaborate. But the recipes are only part of the book, as Curry introduces each one with mini-essays whose subjects range from theological questions to religious history to his own 40-plus years of experience in the Jesuit community. A cookbook that intersperses recipes w0not appeal to everyone, but Curry, who is also the founder and director of the National Theater Workshop of the Handicapped, is a natural storyteller, and his text is very readable.

The characters in <i>Quarantine</i>�openly gay Indian-American men�are Westernized in some ways, with cosmopolitan views on friendship and sex, while struggling to maintain relationships with their families and cultural traditions. Grappling with the issues that concern all gay men�social acceptance, the right to pursue happiness, and the heavy toll of listening to their hearts and bodies�they confront an elder generation's attachment to old-country ways. Estranged from their cultural in-group and still set apart from larger society, the young men in these lyrical, provocative, emotionally wrenching, yet frequently funny stories find themselves quarantined. </p> <p> Already a runaway success in India, <i>Quarantine</i> marks the debut of a unique literary talent. </p></p><p><p>Rahul Mehta&#x2019;s debut short story collection, <em>Quarantine</em>, won a Lambda Literary Award and the Asian American Literary Award for Fiction.

But, when to the knower of Brahman everything has become the Self, then what should one smell and through what, what should one hear and through what, what should one speak and through what, what should one think and through what, what should know and through what? That owing to which all this is known - through what, O Maitreyi, should one know the knower?"<br>The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is considered by some to be the greatest Upanishad. Likewise, the commentary of Shankara is also regarded as his greatest. The theme is the all-embracing Brahman. The commentary shows how the great truth of the Brahman-Atman identity forms the main purport of all the Vedantic texts in general, and this Upanishad in particular. With Devanagari Sanskrit and English, translation and commentary.</p><p>Sankaracarya arose and once more revivified the Vedanta philosophy. He made it rationalistic philosophy...laid stress upon the intellectual side. He worked out ,rationalised, and placed before men the wonderful coherent system of Advaita. In Sankaracarya we saw tremendous intellectual power throwing the scorching light of reason upon everything. --Swami Vivekananda.</p><h2>The Grown-Up&#39;s Guide to Running Away from Home, Second Edition: Making a New Life Abroad</h2><p>For empty-nesters, early retirees, and even established executives, midlife is the ideal time to turn travel fantasies into real and rewarding experiences.

That is the conviction of many of North America&#39;s leading theologians whose close collaboration over several years bring us this exciting volume. Reconstructing Christian Theology introduces theology in such a way that readers can discern the relevance of historical materials, pose theological questions, and begin to think theologically for themselves. Further, like other projects of the Workgroup on Constructive Theology, this volume stems from a deep desire to model a credible, creative, and engaged contemporary theology. So each chapter tackles major Christian teaching, juxtaposes it with a significant social or cultural challenge, and then reconstructs each in light of the other. The result is an innovative and compelling way to learn how theology can contribute to rethinking the most pressing issues of our day.</p><p>Rebecca S.

McFadden lives in Brooklyn, New York.McFadden, in her powerful seventh novel, tells the story of Easter Bartlett as she journeys from the violent Jim Crow South to the promise of the Harlem Renaissance and the civil rights movement. Along the way, Easter forms relationships with both products of McFadden's imagination and actual historical figures: Rain, the sensuous and passionate dancer in Slocum's Traveling Brigade, a troupe that traveled the backwoods entertaining negroes; Colin, Easter's husband, who is provoked by a duplicitous friend into assassinating the Universal Negro Improvement Association leader, Marcus Garvey; Meredith, Easter's untrustworthy benefactor; and many more, including poet Langston Hughes, pianist Fats Waller, and shipping heiress Nancy Cunard. McFadden (<i>Sugar</i>) weaves rich historical detail with Easter's struggle to find peace in a racially polarized country, and she brings Harlem to astounding life: The air up there, up south, up in Harlem, was sticky sweet and peppered with perfume, sweat, sex, curry, salt meat, saut�ed chicken livers, and fresh baked breads. Easter's hope for love to overthrow hate&#x2014;and her intense exposure to both&#x2014;cogently stands for America's potential, and McFadden's novel is a triumphant portrayal of the ongoing quest. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet, The Sonic Color Line argues that American ideologies of white supremacy are just as dependent on what we hear&#x2014;voices, musical taste, volume&#x2014;as they are on skin color or hair texture. Reinforcing compelling new ideas about the relationship between race and sound with meticulous historical research, Jennifer Lynn Stoever helps us to better understand how sound and listening not only register the racial politics of our world, but actively produce them. Through analysis of the historical traces of sounds of African American performers, Stoever reveals a host of racialized aural representations operating at the level of the unseen&#x2014;the sonic color line&#x2014;and exposes the racialized listening practices she figures as &#x201c;the listening ear.&#x201d; </p><p>Using an innovative multimedia archive spanning 100 years of American history (1845-1945) and several artistic genres&#x2014;the slave narrative, opera, the novel, so-called &#x201c;dialect stories,&#x201d; folk and blues, early sound cinema, and radio drama&#x2014;The Sonic Color Line explores how black thinkers conceived the cultural politics of listening at work during slavery, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow. By amplifying Harriet Jacobs, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, Charles Chesnutt, The Fisk Jubilee Singers, Ann Petry, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Lena Horne as agents and theorists of sound, Stoever provides a new perspective on key canonical works in African American literary history. In the process, she radically revises the established historiography of sound studies. The Sonic Color Line sounds out how Americans have created, heard, and resisted &#x201c;race,&#x201d; so that we may hear our contemporary world differently.</p></p><p><b>Jennifer Lynn Stoever </b>is Associate Professor of English at the State University of New York at Binghamton. She is co-founder and Editor-in-Chief of Sounding Out!: The Sound Studies Blog."The Sonic Color Linewill open up new vistas for thinking about sound, race, and identity, and for understanding how racism is enforced through both sounding and listening. Painstakingly researched and written with verve, Stoevers book will shape the way scholars of American and African American culture and history think about sound, even when our primary texts, like photographs and literary works, are seemingly silent." (Gayle Wald,author of It's Been Beautiful: Soul! and Black Power Television)<br><br>"A gripping read and a rousing call to political attunement by way of sound, The Sonic Color Line investigates scenes of racialized audition from Civil War times to the Civil Rights era. This theoretically rich and passionately argued book made me wiser about the social relations that define sound, the resonant events that suggest how the ear is disciplined, the racial politics of listening that extend into every corner of the republic." (Eric Lott,City University of New York Graduate Center)<br><br>"That the critical intertexts for this book are not only scholarly works but also the Black Lives Matter movement and the many other political movements dedicated to racial justice is a key element in its timeliness and appeal. Engaged scholarship dedicated to an ethics of equality, community, and demystification is a powerful necessity in these times of increasing uncertainty about what 'America' is and how it came to be."

I&#x2019;ve heard...&#x201d;</i><br><br>Ambrose Minstrel, the inventor, is undoubtedly eccentric. But even his oddities cannot account for the strange events at Meade House. Young Hugo Ross, Minstrel&#x2019;s new secretary, feels that all the dark happenings centre somehow on himself &#x2013; cryptic remarks and veiled glances between Minstrel and his assistant, stealthy footsteps in the dead of night, the offer of a small fortune for the worthless field glasses. And then there is the unknown girl who had called from the dark, the rest of her statement swallowed by the night? But in spite of all his caution, Hugo Ross is drawn into a despicable plot involving government intrigue and espionage. With his own life on the line, how much is he willing to risk for his country?<br><br><i>Fool Errant</i> was originally published in 1929, and introduced the eccentric, elderly series character of Benbow Smith.

By the time the war ended, Raus had established a reputation as one of the German army&#39;s foremost tacticians of armored warfare, which made him a prized capture by U.S. Army intelligence. In American captivity, Raus wrote a detailed memoir of his service in Russia. His battlefield experience and keen tactical eye makes his memoir especially valuable.The Raus memoir-now translated, compiled, and edited by prominent World War II historian Steven H. Newton-covers the Russian campaign from the first day of the war to his being relieved of his command at Hitler&#39;s order in the spring of 1945. It includes a detailed examination of Raus&#39;s 6th Panzer Division&#39;s drive to Leningrad, his experiences in the Soviet winter counteroffensive around Moscow, the unsuccessful attempt to relieve Stalingrad and the final desperate battles inside Germany at the end of the war.</p><p>Steven H.

The message that every Christian man and woman, whatever their place of work or calling, is called to sanctity has touched countless lives; this work offers a starting-point for a prayer which finds Christ in all the experience of living. A special feature of this new edition is the footnotes, drafted not only for those approaching the book as a tool to help them pray, but having in mind also readers studying the text as an example of 20th Century Spanish literature.

Saint Damien was born Jozef de Veuster, on January 3, 1840, to a Flemish corn merchant in Belgium. He entered the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary and after his novitiate was sent to Hawaii to serve as a missionary. When he arrived in Honolulu, in March, 1864, Damien found Hawaii in the midst of a public health crisis. In 1865, the Hawaiian Government passed measures calling for the relocation of leprosy patients to the Island of Molokai. There the Hawaiian Government built a village, provided food and supplies for growing crops. However, the village soon fell into disrepair. Bishop Louis Desire Maigret asked for priests to see to the physical and spiritual needs of the lepers and he called for volunteers. Saint Damien was one of four priests who volunteered. He arrived on Molokai on May 10, 1873, and stayed until his death sixteen years later in 1884. Those who read the life of St. Damien will learn to see others as he saw them. Damien saw the dignity and beauty of each person he served, where others saw only pain and misery. He saw others as brothers and sisters and offered people new hope. Those who read the life of Damien are inspired to recognize the needs of people around them and offer them assistance, even when it is difficult.

She lives in Southern California with her husband, Allen, a large number of quilts, and twenty pairs of cowboy boots.Albenia (Benni) Harper is a curator of the Joseph Sinclair Folk Art Museum and Artist Co-op in San Celina California. She married her second husband, a Police Chief named Gabe, just fifteen months ago. When she meets with her friend, who is also a lawyer, she is surprised with the news that a man named Jacob Chandler has left her a house and all his possessions - as long as she agrees to reside in the house for two weeks. Otherwise, the inheritance will revert to the government. What really surprises her about this turn of events is that she has no idea whom Jacob Chandler is. When Benni goes to the house, she finds out that she has also inherited a dog named Scout. This is one of the less disturbing finds. Benni starts to get spooked when she finds a carved horse with the name of her first horse on it and an old jacket that she thought she had lost. Benni starts to investigate who this Jacob Chandler, was using his friends and acquaintances, and finds herself on a strange scavenger hunt. She also has to deal with some antagonism from the people that feel they should have been the recipients of this windfall, a protective husband, a grandmother who has taken the local historical society hostage and the mystery of why this stranger knew so much about her. Benni's two weeks are full of suspense, fear, and confusion and in the end, a surprise she just wasn't expecting. This mystery is a true page-turner (please excuse the clich�). Benni and her family are a treat to read about and the suspense over Jacob Chandler drives the story at a very quick pace. The plot was very well developed, both the story and the character motivations and roles seemed real and even more importantly plausible. Earlene Fowler has written a great mystery. I found myself admiring the mind that came up with this premise and executed it so well. I was really pleased to see that she has written other books and I plan to search them out. An unique story with an intriguing mystery. Earlene Fowler is a name that should show up on every mystery lover's bookshelf. Mariner's Compass is a great why-done-it.

For such a character, one book is not enough&#x2014;readers must know what happens next. Now Dean Koontz returns with the novel his fans have been demanding. With the emotional power and sheer storytelling artistry that are his trademarks, Koontz takes up once more the story of a unique young hero and an eccentric little town in a tale that is equal parts suspense and terror, adventure and mystery&#x2014;and altogether irresistibly odd.<br><br>We&#x2019;re all a little odd beneath the surface. He&#x2019;s the most unlikely hero you&#x2019;ll ever meet&#x2014;an ordinary guy with a modest job you might never look at twice. But there&#x2019;s so much more to any of us than meets the eye&#x2014;and that goes triple for Odd Thomas. For Odd lives always between two worlds in the small desert town of Pico Mundo, where the heroic and the harrowing are everyday events. Odd never asked to communicate with the dead&#x2014;it&#x2019;s something that just happened. But as the unofficial goodwill ambassador between our world and theirs, he&#x2019;s got a duty to do the right thing. That&#x2019;s the way Odd sees it and that&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s won hearts on both sides of the divide between life and death.<br><br>A childhood friend of Odd&#x2019;s has disappeared. The worst is feared. But as Odd applies his unique talents to the task of finding the missing person, he discovers something worse than a dead body, encounters an enemy of exceptional cunning, and spirals into a vortex of terror. Once again Odd will stand against our worst fears. Around him will gather new allies and old, some living and some not. For in the battle to come, there can be no innocent bystanders, and every sacrifice can tip the balance between despair and hope. Whether you&#x2019;re meeting Odd Thomas for the first time or he&#x2019;s already an old friend, you&#x2019;ll be led on an unforgettable journey through a world of terror, wonder and delight&#x2014;to a revelation that can change your life.

This mild February night was not, however, sweetened by the scent of rain. I hoped to hear the fading rumble of thunder. If a peal had awakened me, it must have been thunder in a dream. <br><br>Holding my breath, I lay listening to the silence, and felt the silence listening to me. The nightstand clock painted glowing numbers on the gloom&#x2014;2:41 A.M. <br><br>For a moment I considered remaining in bed. But these days I do not sleep as well as I did when I was young. I am twenty-one and much older than when I was twenty. <br><br>Certain that I had company, expecting to find two Elvises watching over me, one with a cocky smile and one with sad concern, I sat up and switched on the lamp. A single Elvis stood in a corner: a life-size cardboard figure that had been part of a theater-lobby display for <i>Blue Hawaii</i>. In a Hawaiian shirt and a lei, he looked self-confident and happy. <br><br>Back in 1961, he'd had much to be happy about. <i>Blue Hawaii</i> was a hit film, and the album went to number one. He had six gold records that year, including "Can't Help Falling in Love," and he was falling in love with Priscilla Beaulieu. <br><br>Less happily, at the insistence of his manager, Tom Parker, he had turned down the lead in <i>West Side Story</i> in favor of mediocre movie fare like Follow <i>That Dream.</i> Gladys Presley, his beloved mother, had been dead three years, and still he felt the loss of her, acutely. Only twenty-six, he'd begun to have weight problems. <br><br>Cardboard Elvis smiles eternally, forever young, incapable of error or regret, untouched by grief, a stranger to despair. <br><br>I envy him. There is no cardboard replica of me as I once was and as I can never be again. <br><br>The lamplight revealed another presence, as patient as he was desperate. Evidently he had been watching me sleep, waiting for me to wake. <br><br>I said, "Hello, Dr. Jessup." <br><br>Dr. Wilbur Jessup was incapable of a response. Anguish flooded his face. His eyes were desolate pools; all hope had drowned in those lonely depths. <br>"I'm sorry to see you here," I said. <br><br>He made fists of his hands, not with the intention of striking anything, but as an expression of frustration. He pressed his fists to his chest. <br><br>Dr. Jessup had never previously visited my apartment; and I knew in my heart that he no longer belonged in Pico Mundo. But I clung to denial, and I spoke to him again as I got out of bed. <br><br>"Did I leave the door unlocked?" <br><br>He shook his head. Tears blurred his eyes, but he did not wail or even whimper. Fetching a pair of jeans from the closet, slipping into them, I said, "I've been forgetful lately." <br><br>He opened his fists and stared at his palms. His hands trembled. He buried his face in them. <br><br>"There's so much I'd like to forget," I continued as I pulled on socks and shoes, "but only the small stuff slips my mind-like where I left the keys, whether I locked the door, that I'm out of milk. . . ."<br><br>Dr. Jessup, a radiologist at County General Hospital, was a gentle man, and quiet, although he had never before been <i>this</i> quiet. Because I had not worn a T-shirt to bed, I plucked a white one from a drawer. I have a few black T-shirts, but mostly white. In addition to a selection of blue jeans, I have two pair of white chinos. <br><br>This apartment provides only a small closet. Half of it is empty. So are the bottom drawers of my dresser. <br><br>I do not own a suit. Or a tie. Or shoes that need to be shined. <br><br>For cool weather, I own two crew-neck sweaters. <br><br>Once I bought a sweater vest. Temporary insanity. Realizing that I had introduced an unthinkable level of complexity to my wardrobe, I returned it to the store the next day. <br><br>My four-hundred-pound friend and mentor, P. Oswald Boone, has warned me that my sartorial style represents a serious threat to the apparel industry. <br><br>I've noted more than once that the articles in Ozzie's wardrobe are of such enormous dimensions that he keeps in business those fabric mills I might otherwise put in jeopardy. <br><br>Barefoot, Dr. Jessup wore cotton pajamas. They were wrinkled from the rigors of restless sleep. <br><br>"Sir, I wish you'd say something," I told him. "I really wish you would." <br><br>Instead of obliging me, the radiologist lowered his hands from his face, turned, and walked out of the bedroom. <br><br>I glanced at the wall above the bed. Framed behind glass is a card from a carnival fortune-telling machine. It promises YOU ARE DESTINED TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. <br><br>Each morning, I begin my day by reading those seven words. Each night, I read them again, sometimes more than once, before sleep, if sleep will come to me. <br><br>I am sustained by the certainty that life has meaning. As does death. <br><br>From a nightstand, I retrieved my cell phone. The first number on speed dial is the office of Wyatt Porter, chief of the Pico Mundo Police Department. The second is his home number. The third is his cell phone. <br><br>More likely than not, I would be calling Chief Porter, one place or another, before dawn. <br><br>In the living room, I turned on a light and discovered that Dr. Jessup had been standing in the dark, among the thrift-shop treasures with which the place is furnished. <br><br>When I went to the front door and opened it, he did not follow. <br><br>Although he had sought my assistance, he couldn't find the courage for what lay ahead. <br><br>In the rubescent light from an old bronze lamp with a beaded shade, the eclectic decor-Stickley-style armchairs, plump Victorian footstools, Maxfield Parrish prints, carnival-glass vases-evidently appealed to him. <br><br>"No offense," I said, "but you don't belong here, sir." Dr. Jessup silently regarded me with what might have been supplication. "This place is filled to the brim with the past. There's room for Elvis and me, and memories, but not for anyone new." <br><br>I stepped into the public hall and pulled the door shut. <br><br>My apartment is one of two on the first floor of a converted Victorian house. Once a rambling single-family home, the place still offers considerable charm. For years I lived in one rented room above a garage. My bed had been just a few steps from my refrigerator. Life was simpler then, and the future clear. I traded that place for this not because I needed more space, but because my heart is here now, and forever. <br><br>The front door of the house featured an oval of leaded glass. The night beyond looked sharply beveled and organized into a pattern that anyone could understand. <br><br>When I stepped onto the porch, this night proved to be like all others: deep, mysterious, trembling with the potential for chaos. From porch steps to flagstone path, to public sidewalk, I looked around for Dr. Jessup but didn't see him. In the high desert, which rises far east beyond Pico Mundo, winter can be chilly, while our low-desert nights remain mild even in February. The curbside Indian laurels sighed and whispered in the balmy wind, and moths soared to street lamps. <br><br>The surrounding houses were as quiet as their windows were dark. No dogs barked. No owls hooted. <br><br>No pedestrians were out, no traffic on the streets. The town looked as if the Rapture had occurred, as if only I had been left behind to endure the reign of Hell on Earth. <br><br>By the time I reached the corner, Dr. Jessup rejoined me. His pajamas and the lateness of the hour suggested that he had come to my apartment from his home on Jacaranda Way, five blocks north in a better neighborhood than mine. Now he led me in that direction. <br><br>He could fly, but he plodded. I ran, drawing ahead of him. <br><br>Although I dreaded what I would find no less than he might have dreaded revealing it to me, I wanted to get to it quickly. As far as I knew, a life might still be in jeopardy. <br><br>Halfway there, I realized that I could have taken the Chevy. For most of my driving life, having no car of my own, I borrowed from friends as needed. The previous autumn, I had inherited a 1980 Chevrolet Camaro Berlinetta Coupe. <br><br>Often I still act as though I have no wheels. Owning a few thousand pounds of vehicle oppresses me when I think about it too much. Because I try not to think about it, I sometimes forget I have it. <br><br>Under the cratered face of the blind moon, I ran. <br><br>On Jacaranda Way, the Jessup residence is a white-brick Georgian with elegant ornamentation. It is flanked by a delightful American Victorian with so many decorative moldings that it resembles a wedding cake, and by a house that is baroque in all the wrong ways. <br><br>None of these architectural styles seems right for the desert, shaded by palm trees, brightened by climbing bougainvillea. Our town was founded in 1900 by newcomers from the East Coast, who fled the harsh winters but brought with them cold-climate architecture and attitude. <br><br>Terri Stambaugh, my friend and employer, owner of the Pico Mundo Grille, tells me that this displaced architecture is better than the dreary acres of stucco and graveled roofs in many California desert towns. <br><br>I assume that she is right. I have seldom crossed the city line of Pico Mundo and have never been beyond the boundaries of Maravilla County. <br><br>My life is too full to allow either a jaunt or a journey. I don't even watch the Travel Channel. <br><br>The joys of life can be found anywhere. Far places only offer exotic ways to suffer. <br><br>Besides, the world beyond Pico Mundo is haunted by strangers, and I find it difficult enough to cope with the dead who, in life, were known to me. Upstairs and down, soft lamplight shone at some windows of the Jessup residence. Most panes were dark. By the time I reached the foot of the front-porch steps, Dr. Wilbur Jessup waited there. <br><br>The wind stirred his hair and ruffled his pajamas, although why he should be subject to the wind, I do not know. The moonlight found him, too, and shadow. The grieving radiologist needed comforting before he could summon sufficient strength to lead me into his house, where he himself no doubt lay dead, and perhaps another. <br><br>I embraced him. Only a spirit, he was invisible to everyone but me, yet he felt warm and solid. <br><br>Perhaps I see the dead affected by the weather of this world, and see them touched by light and shadow, and find them as warm as the living, not because this is the way they are but because this is the way I want them to be. Perhaps by this device, I mean to deny the power of death. <br><br>My supernatural gift might reside not in my mind but instead in my heart. The heart is an artist that paints over what profoundly disturbs it, leaving on the canvas a less dark, less sharp version of the truth. <br><br>Dr. Jessup had no substance, but he leaned heavily upon me, a weight. He shook with the sobs that he could not voice. <br><br>The dead don't talk. Perhaps they know things about death that the living are not permitted to learn from them. <br><br>In this moment, my ability to speak gave me no advantage. Words would not soothe him. <br><br>Nothing but justice could relieve his anguish. Perhaps not even justice. When he'd been alive, he had known me as Odd Thomas, a local character. I am regarded by some people-wrongly-as a hero, as an eccentric by nearly everyone. <i><br><br>Odd</i> is not a nickname; it's my legal handle. <br><br>The story of my name is interesting, I suppose, but I've told it before. What it boils down to is that my parents are dysfunctional. Big-time. I believe that in life Dr. Jessup had found me intriguing, amusing, puzzling. I think he had liked me. <br><br>Only in death did he know me for what I am: a companion to the lingering dead. I see them and wish I did not. I cherish life too much to turn the dead away, however, for they deserve my compassion by virtue of having suffered this world. <br><br>When Dr. Jessup stepped back from me, he had changed. His wounds were now manifest. <br><br>He had been hit in the face with a blunt object, maybe a length of pipe or a hammer. Repeatedly. His skull was broken, his features distorted. Torn, cracked, splintered, his hands suggested that he had desperately tried to defend himself-or that he had come to the aid of someone. The only person living with him was his son, Danny. <br><br>My pity was quickly exceeded by a kind of righteous rage, which is a dangerous emotion, clouding judgment, precluding caution. <br><br>In this condition, which I do not seek, which frightens me, which comes over me as though I have been possessed, I can't turn away from what must be done. I plunge. My friends, those few who know my secrets, think my compulsion has a divine inspiration. Maybe it's just temporary insanity. <br><br>Step to step, ascending, then crossing the porch, I considered phoning Chief Wyatt Porter. I worried, however, that Danny might perish while I placed the call and waited for the authorities. <br><br>The front door stood ajar. <br><br>I glanced back and saw that Dr. Jessup preferred to haunt the yard instead of the house. He lingered in the grass. <br><br>His wounds had vanished. He appeared as he had appeared before Death had found him-and he looked scared. <br><br>Until they move on from this world, even the dead can know fear. You would think they have nothing to lose, but sometimes they are wretched with anxiety, not about what might lie Beyond, but about those whom they have left behind. I pushed the door inward. It moved as smoothly, as silently as the mechanism of a well-crafted, spring-loaded trap.</p><h2>The Merck Manual of Health &amp; Aging</h2><p>From one of the most trusted names in medical references comes an accessible, all-inclusive guide for older adults that shares what measures to take to optimize the aging process, prevent disease, and improve your overall health.

A baby develops and matures into an adult. Then, at some point, the aging process changes. The person begins a decline in function that ultimately leads to death&#x2014;what people usually think of as aging or growing old. The technical term for this decline in function that ends in death is &#x201c;senescence.&#x201d;<br><br> Science can provide information about changes in the body that lead to aging and death. Science can determine how some of the changes occur. But two basic mysteries remain: whether aging and dying have a purpose and, if so, what that purpose is. Throughout history, people have responded to these mysteries by searching for a &#x201c;fountain of youth&#x201d; that will prolong the time spent as vigorous, healthy young adults. And the search continues as researchers look for ways to slow or reverse the aging process.<br><br> Some progress has been made in the search. During the last century, life expectancy for people in the United States has greatly increased. As a result, what people consider to be old age has changed dramatically. Improvements in life expectancy occurred in two stages. First, death during childhood has become less likely, largely because sanitation has improved and because vaccines and treatments for childhood diseases, such as antibiotics, were developed. Second, disease and disability have become less likely to develop or have been postponed in older people because health care and approaches to prevention have improved. In spite of these improvements, even the healthiest and luckiest people do not live beyond about age 130.<br><br> Looking for the Fountain of Youth<br><br> Books about how to stay young and live longer abound. Almost everyone is interested in living a long life and looking and feeling young. No Ponce de Leons are traveling to new lands on a search for a magic fountain to restore their youth. However, researchers are looking at genes, cells, hormones, eating patterns, and other factors for clues about what causes aging and how to prevent or slow it.<br><br> Research has identified three strategies that may help people live longer: exercising, following certain types of diets, and eating fewer calories.<br><br> People who exercise are healthier than those who do not. Exercise has many established health benefits: improving and maintaining the ability to function, maintaining a healthy weight, and helping prevent or postpone disorders such as coronary artery disease and diabetes.<br><br> People who eat a low-fat diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables are healthier than people who eat more fat and starch. Also, people who live in Mediterranean countries and consume the so-called Mediterranean diet seem to live longer. This diet is generally thought to be healthier than northern European and American diets because it consists of more grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and fish and less red meat. In addition, the main fat consumed is olive oil. Olive oil contains many vitamins and consists mainly of monounsaturated fat rather than saturated fat. Monounsaturated fats do not increase cholesterol the way saturated fats do.<br><br> A low-calorie diet over a lifetime may lead to longer life because it reduces the number of certain damaging substances in the body. These substances, called free radicals, are by-products of the normal activity of cells. The damage done to cells by free radicals is thought to contribute to aging and to disorders such as coronary artery disease and cancer. But no studies to test this theory have been done in people.<br><br> These three strategies would require a change in lifestyle for most people. Consequently, many people look for other, less demanding ways to prevent or slow aging. For example, they may look for other ways to manage free radicals. Substances called antioxidants can neutralize free radicals and thus help prevent damage to cells. Vitamins C and E are antioxidants. So some people take large amounts of these vitamins as supplements in the hope of slowing the aging process. Other antioxidants, such as beta-carotene (a form of vitamin A), are also sometimes taken as supplements. In theory, the use of antioxidants to prevent aging makes sense. However, no studies have shown that antioxidants prevent or slow aging.<br><br> Levels of some hormones decrease as people age. Another way people try to delay or slow aging is to take supplements of these hormones. Examples are testosterone, estrogen, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), human growth hormone, and melatonin. But whether hormonal supplements have any effect on aging is unknown. Furthermore, some of these supplements have known risks.<br><br> Some people believe that Eastern practices, such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong, can prolong life. These practices are based on the principle that health involves the whole person (physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual) and balance within the body. The practices may include relaxation, breathing techniques, diet, and meditation as well as exercise. They are safe for older people and probably improve their health. But whether these practices prolong life is difficult to prove.<br><br> When Does a Person Become Old?<br><br> The traditional designation for old age&#x2014;65 years&#x2014;has no basis in biology. Many people are vigorous and active at 65. Others are sick and inactive at 40. Rather, the basis for choosing age 65 is in history. Age 65 was chosen as the age for retirement in Germany, the first nation to establish a retirement program. (In 1889, Bismarck, Germany&#x2019;s Chancellor, first chose age 70, but in 1916, the age was lowered to 65.)<br><br> The question as to when a person becomes old can be answered in different ways. Chronologic age is based solely on the passage of time. It is a person&#x2019;s age in years. Chronologic age has limited significance in terms of health. Nonetheless, the likelihood of developing a health problem increases as people age. Because chronologic age helps predict many health problems, it has some legal and financial uses. It is also used to determine eligibility for some programs for older people.<br><br> Biological age refers to changes in the body that commonly occur as people age. For example, vision and hearing typically worsen as people age. Because these changes affect some people more than others, some people are biologically old at 40, and others are biologically young at 60 and even older.<br><br> Psychologic age is based on how people act and feel. For example, an 80-year-old who works, plans, looks forward to future events, and participates in many activities is considered psychologically young. Such a person is commonly described as &#x201c;being young at heart.&#x201d;<br><br> People often wonder whether what they are experiencing as they age is normal or abnormal. Although people age somewhat differently, many changes occur in almost everyone and are thus considered &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; However, a more accurate description of these changes is &#x201c;usual.&#x201d; Usual aging refers to what happens to most people, including disorders that are common among older people. Usual aging does not necessarily mean that the changes are unavoidable or desirable.<br><br> Usual aging was once thought to include such unavoidable changes as muscle weakness, slowed movement, loss of balance, and memory loss. Research has shown that many of these common, &#x201c;normal&#x201d; changes result from an unhealthy lifestyle or from disorders that can be prevented or treated and reversed, rather than from aging itself. So the question to ask may be whether changes can be avoided rather than whether they are &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; This question leads to the concept of healthy aging.<br><br> Healthy aging refers to a postponement of or reduction in the undesired effects of aging. The goals of healthy aging are maintaining physical and mental health, avoiding disorders, and remaining active and independent. For most people, maintaining general good health requires more effort as they age. Certain healthy habits have been shown to reduce the risk of developing several disorders that commonly occur as people age. These habits include following a nutritious diet, exercising regularly, and staying mentally active. Developing these habits is an important part of healthy aging. The sooner a person develops them, the better. However, it is never too late to begin.1 In this way, people can have some control over what happens to them as they age.<br><br> Why Does the Body Change?<br><br> The body changes with aging because changes occur in individual cells and in whole organs. These changes result in changes in function, in appearance, and thus in the experience of aging.<br><br> Aging Cells<br><br> As cells age, they function less well. Eventually, they must die, as a normal part of the body&#x2019;s functioning.<br><br> Cells may die because they do not divide normally or because they are damaged. Cells may be damaged by harmful substances in the environment, such as radiation, sunlight, and <br><br> 1. see page 33<br><br> chemotherapy drugs. Cells may also be damaged by certain by-<br><br> products of their own normal activities. These by-products, called free radicals, are given off when cells produce energy.<br><br> Many cells die because the genes they contain program a process that, when triggered, results in death of the cell. This programmed death, called apoptosis, is a kind of cell suicide. Reasons for cell suicide include replacing old cells with new ones and eliminating excess cells.<br><br> Also, cells die because they can divide only a limited number of times. This limit is also programmed by genes. When a cell can no longer divide, it grows larger, exists for a while, then dies. The mechanism that limits cell division involves a structure called a telomere. Telomeres are used to move the cell&#x2019;s genetic material in preparation for cell division. Every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten a bit. Eventually, the telomeres become so short that the cell can no longer divide. The telomeres of cancer cells, unlike those of normal cells, do not shorten each time the cell divides. Consequently, cancer cells can divide forever.<br><br> Aging Organs<br><br> How well organs function depends on how well the cells within them function. Older cells function less well. Also, in some organs, cells die and are not replaced, so the number of cells decreases. The number of cells in the testes, ovaries, liver, and kidneys decreases markedly as the body ages. When the number of cells becomes too low, an organ cannot function normally. Thus, most organs function less well as people age. However, not all organs lose a large number of cells. The brain is one example. Healthy older people do not lose many brain cells. Substantial losses occur mainly in people who have had strokes or who have Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease or Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.<br><br> A decline in one organ&#x2019;s function, whether due to a disorder or to aging itself, can affect the function of another. For example, if atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels to the kidneys, the kidneys function less well because blood flow to them is decreased.<br><br> Why Does Function Decline?<br><br> For most people most of the time, the decline in organ function does not affect the body&#x2019;s ability to function during normal daily activities. People usually notice the decline in organ function only when very demanding tasks are attempted or when a disorder develops. For example, the amount of blood pumped by the heart during vigorous exercise decreases as people age. Older people may notice this change only when they play tennis or jog, not when they take a walk. They may notice changes in brain function only when they try to learn new information, such as a new language.<br><br> A noticeable decline in function is more likely to result from factors other than aging itself. The most common culprit is a disorder. A disorder may cause pain or confusion, make movement more difficult, rob a person of energy, or lead to depression.<br><br> The psychologic, sociologic, and financial situation of older people affects their behavior. Their behavior, in turn, affects their ability to function. Fear or worry may cause older people to become less active. If older people are less active, their ability to function tends to decline. Older people may fear being hurt or embarrassed, so they withdraw from their favorite activities and stay home. Older people with balance problems may fear that they might fall and break a bone. Older people with urinary incontinence may worry that they could have a wetting accident. Not having a partner with whom to share experiences or not having adequate funds may also stop people from participating in activities. People who participate in meaningful activities tend to remain healthy and live longer, as do people who have social support (married men in particular), adequate funds (those in a higher socioeconomic bracket), and a higher educational level.<br><br> Taking preventive measures can help older people remain healthy, active, and able to function.1 Older people can develop healthy habits and continue to participate in activities. Learning to recognize situations and tendencies (such as fear) that can lead to further problems can help. Having a positive attitude toward aging&#x2014;expecting life to continue to be full, hopeful, and worthwhile&#x2014;can also help.<br><br> If older people remain fit and well, they do not lose their ability to remember, learn, think, and reason. They can remain physically active and capable. They can adapt to change. They can resist most disorders. When they develop a disorder, they can tolerate and respond to medical and surgical treatments and usually recover.</p><h2>The Last Bachelor in Texas: A Brazos Bend novel (Welcome to Brazos Bend)</h2><p>Love and duty calls talent manager Tess Armstrong away from the glamor of Hollywood to sleepy little Brazos Bend, Texas to care for her wild-child sister&#x2019;s newborn twins.

She instinctively knew that her ex-brother-in-law was involved in these horrifying acts of terrorism, and her heart went out to America. She also knew that her life and the lives of her family would never be the same again. Carmen bin Ladin, half Swiss and half Persian, married into and later divorced from the bin Laden family and found herself inside a complex and vast clan, part of a society that she neither knew nor understood. Her story takes us inside the bin Laden family and one of the most powerful, secretive, and repressed kingdoms in the world.<br><br></p><p>Carmen Bin Laden, a Swiss-Iranian raised in Geneva, married a brother of Osama in the U.S. Upon moving to Arabia, she was appalled by Saudi culture and later took refuge in Switzerland, where her marriage broke up. She gives an insider's look at what she describes as the suffocating, self-righteous, pathological Saudi culture, inimical to the West. A bone-headed literalism (if the author has an accent, so must the reader . . .) gives us Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo's nar-ration, earnest but slow and painfully awkward, and corny "Middle Eastern" music. But Bin Laden's message comes through, summed up in her reminder that the majority of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudi. W.M. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Addicted to the "I-married-the-Mob" genre? Try this variation: smart women who marry Islamic fundamentalists. In 1973, Swiss-born Carmen fell in love with Yeslam bin Ladin, Osama's older brother; after a fairy-tale courtship, including a semester together at USC, the two married in Saudi Arabia. Alas, it wasn't long before the fantasy turned sinister. By Saudi Wahhabi custom, women are usually confined to the home. Activities like listening to music or reading books other than the Koran are either sinful or shameful. Only Carmen's young daughters, occasional international trips and her dear, understanding husband helped her cope. Then, things worsened. The 1979 Saudi mobilization to support Afghan Muslims against the Soviet invasion gave religious hard-liners like Osama more clout. Carmen's husband, now a successful Geneva businessman, reverted to a more orthodox lifestyle. Finally, in 1988, Yeslam divorced Carmen, but by bringing charges against her in Saudi Arabia, made certain she feared for her life&#x2014;and her daughters' freedom&#x2014;if she ever again entered an Islamic country. Beyond Carmen's terrible story hovers the larger, later tragedy of 9/11. Remember, Carmen warns, the bin Laden brothers have always supported each other, financially and socially. When Osama dies, he'll certainly be replaced. The gravity of the events Carmen writes of, her insider's perspective and her engaging style make this memoir a page-turner.

The many variants of rhythmic notation, standard and experimental alike, encountered in contemporary music frequently demand explanation and interpretation. This book catalogs and clarifies the numerous ways of notating syncopation and alternative standard rhythmic figures, new time signatures, irrational rhythmic groupings within regular and irregular meters, experimental metrical concepts and techniques, analogs, and, finally, polymeters. Read compares traditional and present-day methods of delineating the same musical expressions, from fairly simple combinations to extremely complicated patterns. </p></p><p></p><h2>Stuarts&#x2019; Field Guide to National Parks &amp; Game Reserves of East Africa.

Reading Mormonism through a synthesis of religious history, political theology, native studies, and queer theory, Peter Coviello deftly crafts a new framework for imagining orthodoxy, citizenship, and the fate of the flesh in nineteenth-century America. What emerges is a story about the violence, wild beauty, and extravagant imaginative power of this era of Mormonism&#x2014;an impassioned book with a keen interest in the racial history of sexuality and the unfinished business of American secularism.<br> </p></p><p><b>Peter Coviello</b> is professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

It&#39;s a story of meticulous craftsmanship and unimaginable wealth, of lucky escapes and mysterious disappearances, and ultimately of greed, tragedy and devotion. Moreover, it is a story that mirrors the history of twentieth-century Russia - a satisfying arc that sees eggs made for the tsars, sold by Stalin, bought by Americans and now, finally, returned to post-communist Russia. There is also an intriguing element of mystery surrounding the masterpieces. Of the fifty &#39;Tsar Imperial&#39; eggs known to have been made, eight are currently unaccounted for, providing endless scope for speculation and forgeries. This is the first book to tell the complete history of the eggs, encompassing the love and opulence in which they were conceived, the war and revolution that scattered them, and the collectors who preserved them.</p><p></p><h2>Ghosts of the Green Swamp (Cracker Western)</h2><p>Cracker Westerns are rip-roarin, action-packed, can't-put-'em-down tales set in the frontier days of Florida.

Tate and Monk&#x2014;and an odd assortment of other characters&#x2014;follow a trail that draws them ever deeper into that vast forbidding swampland near the headwaters of the Withlacoochee River.

One of the formations they encountered was a similarly elite group of paratroopers, who instead of dropping from the skies fought on the defensive, giving their Allied counterparts a tremendous challenge in achieving their objectives.<br><br>This is the complete wartime history of one of the largest German paratrooper regiments, 6th , from its initial formation in the spring of 1943 to its last day at the end of the war. With numerous firsthand accounts from key members, reporting on their experiences, they describe the events of 1943&#x2013;45 vividly and without compromise. <br><br>These accounts reveal previously unknown details about important operations in Italy, Russia, on the Normandy Front, Belgium, Holland, the last German Parachute drop in the Ardennes, and the final battle to the end in Germany.<br><br>With over 220 original photographs, many from private collections and never before published, this book fully illustrates the men, their uniforms, equipment and weapons. Also included is an appendix with maps, battle calendar, staffing plans, a list of field and post-MOB-numbers, and the Knight's Cross recipients of the regiment. Having earned the respect of the Allied forces who fought against it during World War II, this work will inform current readers of the full record of Fallschirmj�ger Regiment 6, and why the Allied advance into German-held Europe was so painstaking to achieve.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface<br><br>1.

The fast-moving account traces their intricate tug-of war, uncovering surprising details that led to their deadly encounter through battlefields, courtrooms, bedrooms, and the wildest presidential election in history, counting down the years to their fateful rendezvous on the dueling ground.<br><br> This is politics made personal: shrill accusations, bruising collisions, and a parade of flesh and blood founders struggling--and often failing--to keep their tempers and jealousies in check. Smoldering in the background was a fundamental political divide that threatened to tear the new nation in two, and still persists to this day.<br><br> The Burr and Hamilton that leap out of these pages are passionate, engaging, and utterly human characters inextricably linked together as <i>Rivals unto Death.</i></p><p>Rick Beyer is the best-selling author of the <i>Greatest Stories Never Told </i>series as well as the co-author with Elizabeth Sayles of <i>The Ghost Army of World War II</i>.

Jan Karski, who tried to get F.D.R. to respond to the mass murders of Europe's Jews, will be familiar to many readers, but most of the people profiled here are not. For example, relatively few will have heard of Feng Shan Ho, a Chinese Christian, who saved over 12,000 Jews. When Ho's promotion to consul-general at the Chinese embassy in Vienna coincided with increasing reports of Jewish persecution, he issued visas to Austrian and German Jews, allowing them to emigrate to Shanghai. Ho persisted despite opposition by his own government, which wanted to maintain its relationship with Hitler. [...] Gragg gives a sense of these activists' mind-boggling bravery."&#x2015;<b><i>Publisher's Weekly<br></i></b></p><h2>Do We Need the New Testament?: Letting the Old Testament Speak for Itself</h2><p>Do we need the Old Testament? That&#39;s a familiar question, often asked. But as an Old Testament scholar, John Goldingay turns that question on its head: Do we need the New Testament? What&#39;s new about the New Testament? After all, the Old Testament was the only Bible Jesus and the disciples knew. Jesus affirmed it as the Word of God. Do we need anything more? And what happens when we begin to look at the Old Testament, which is the First Testament, not as a deficient old work in need of a christological makeover, but as a rich and splendid revelation of God&#39;s faithfulness to Israel and the world? In this cheerfully provocative yet probingly serious book, John Goldingay sets the question and views it from a variety of angles. Under his expert hand, each facet unfolds the surprising richness of the Old Testament and challenges us to recalibrate our perspective on it.</p><p>John Goldingay is David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary. His many books include <em>The Theology of the Book of Isaiah</em>, a three-volume <em>Old Testament Theology</em> and commentaries on Psalms, Isaiah and Daniel."[Goldingay's] tome is a breath of fresh air. It is well-written, thoughtful, and thought-provoking and should be required reading for those preaching and teaching. I once met a pastor who made what he thought was a laudatory comment: 'I never preach from the Old Testament since I want to bring people to Jesus.' Goldingay's book is the necessary prescription for this theological life-threatening illness." (Joseph B. Modica, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, Vol. 59, No. 4)<br><br>"Goldingay offers a solid case against the theological inferiority of the OT. <em>Do We Need the New Testament?</em> is a welcome corrective for those insisting that the OT does not speak to Christians today. The book would be a great addition to the library of seminary students, pastors, and informed lay people." (Justin Langford, Journal for the Evangelical Study of the Old Testament, 5.1 (2016))<br><br>"<em>Do We Need the New Testament?</em> offers a much-needed corrective to the tendency to neglect or devalue the OT found in much of the contemporary church. The book would be of great value to any theological student, pastor, or interested layperson who desires to explore the rich theological, spiritual, and ethical resources that the OT has to offer the church or who seeks to gain a better grasp of the relationship between the Testaments. Readers can expect to have their assumptions challenged, their minds informed, and their passion for the OT (re)ignited by Goldingay's insightful and engaging discussion, which pairs penetrating analysis with a fervent love for Israel's Scriptures." (Brittany Kim, Themelios, April 2016)<br><br>"Bible readers who want to think through the relationship between the two testaments and its implications, and who would welcome help from an insightful and outspoken debate partner, should read and ponder this book." (Kenneth A. Cherney Jr., Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly, Spring 2016)<br><br>"With its scholarly tone, this title should be recommended to laypeople, students, and pastors who are familiar with Greek, Hebrew, and Latin and have a knowledge of biblical and secular history." (John Berstein, CBA Retailers + Resources, June 2015)<br><br>"All in all, this book is a delightful, stimulating, and challenging read. . . . Goldingay helps to explain how to interpret and understand the Old Testament's abiding theological witness to our triune God." (Austin Britton, New Horizons, April 2016)<br><br>"A fresh, accessible and at times provocative explanation of the enduring relevance of the Old ('First') Testament for Christians. It will challenge readers to embrace the first seventy percent of the canon as truly Christian Scripture." (Mark J. Boda, professor of Old Testament, McMaster Divinity College, professor, faculty of Theology, McMaster University, Ontario, Canada)<br><br>"John Goldingay is incapable of being uninteresting. I smiled approvingly at many passages in this book and grimaced at a few others, all the while deeply grateful for such a passionate dismantling of pernicious but widely held myths about the Old Testament's theological inferiority. If Goldingay does not quite come to grips with what makes the New Testament new, he nevertheless brilliantly illustrates how the Old Testament is already good news on its own." (Stephen B. Chapman, associate professor of Old Testament, Duke University)<br><br>"The early church's problem with the Old Testament was completely different to ours. Their problem was not how to make sense of the Old Testament given the coming of Jesus, but the reverse: Given that the Old Testament is God's revelation, how do we make sense of Jesus? With this unusual question, <em>Do We Need the New Testament?</em>, Goldingay turns our modern thinking on its head and exposes the weaknesses in the way contemporary Christians understand the Old Testament&#x2015;and the New. With thought-provoking ideas on every page, this book will help readers look at the Old and New Testaments in new and exciting ways."

Kalland Professor of Old Testament and Semitic Languages, Denver Seminary)</p><h2>Early Biblical Interpretation (Library of Early Christianity)</h2><p><p>This highly accessible book discusses how the early Jewish and Christian communities went about interpreting Scripture.</p><p>The Library of Early Christianity is a series of eight outstanding books exploring the Jewish and Greco-Roman contexts in which the New Testament developed.</p></p><p><b>James A. Kugel</b> is Director of the Institute for the History of the Jewish Bible at Bar Ilan University in IsraelThe initial volumes of this new series bring refreshing critical perspectives to the question of early Christian identity. Grant argues that the religious activity of the New Testament must be placed within the matrix of the Greco-Roman experience. After exploring the functions, deeds, and doctrines of the pagan gods, he clearly points out the extent to which the development of Christologies and the doctrine of the Trinity are indebted to pagan expression and reflection. Distilling recent social/historical analyses, Stambaugh and Balch review the history of the period in which Christianity arose and spreadrelevant rural and urban environments and their common economic patterns and assumptions. Chapters on mission and Christian adaptation of urban social forms are major contributions. Kugel and Greer explore the major factors that shaped scriptural interpretation within early Judaism and Christianity. Kugel shows how, when the Jewish past turned into present problematic, scriptural interpretation became a religious activity. Refining past tendencies and presaging future doctrinal debates, Greer demonstrates the notion of a Christian Bible on Irenaeus's synthesis. For university and seminary collections. Arthur J.

And how can he cheer it up?</b> <b>From artist Jenni Desmond comes a warm and funny story about finding a new friend in a very unexpected place.</b><br><br>Awake after his long sleep, Albert the bear can&#x2019;t wait to spend time in his own special tree, which is always so quiet and peaceful. But not today. Today Albert&#x2019;s tree is crying. How can he cheer it up? Albert&#x2019;s friend Rabbit suggests digging holes for Tree to play in, but the wailing continues. Eating grass always makes Caribou happy, but an offering of grass does nothing to stop the noise (which is getting to be a bit much). &#x201c;STOP CRYING!&#x201d; roars Albert, but the bawling only gets louder. There&#x2019;s just one thing to do: Albert climbs up to his favorite branch and gives Tree a hug. To Albert&#x2019;s surprise, he hears a little voice say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid of the big hairy monster.&#x201d; Who said that? And just who <i>is</i> the big hairy monster?</p><p><b>Jenni Desmond </b>is the illustrator of <i>On the Night of the Shooting Star</i> by Amy Hest and the author-illustrator of <i>The Blue Whale</i> and <i>The Polar Bear,</i> among other books for young readers. Jenni Desmond lives and works in London.PreS-K&#x2014;It's spring and Albert the bear is awake and heading to his favorite place&#x2014;his tree. Albert splays out on a branch but hears a strange noise coming from the tree, so he, along with his animal friends, must investigate. Their conclusion: the tree is crying. Bear and the animals grow increasingly frustrated as their attempts at cheering up the tree fail and the wailing continues. When Bear decides to give his tree a hug, he finds out the voice belongs to baby Owl who is afraid of the "monster." When baby owl peeks out, both parties are surprised: Bear is not a monster and the tree's voice belongs to an Owl! The pair end up as fast friends. The primarily green and brown palette of the illustrations stands out against mostly white backgrounds. Hand-lettered comments from the animal friends lend humor to the story.

But once a year, Lorcan transforms her back to her Dra�olon form and offers a truce. And every year Evelayn refuses -- for he requires her to Bind herself to him for life.<br><br>But now, with an Ancient power bearing down upon them, everything may change. Evelayn will learn that the truths she once believed have shattered, and that she may need her enemies even more than her allies.

In an analysis of films dating from America&#39;s first Red Scare in the wake of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution to the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Tony Shaw examines the complex relationship between filmmakers, censors, politicians, and government propagandists. Movies, Shaw demonstrates, were at the center of the Cold War&#39;s battle for hearts and minds. Hollywood&#39;s comedies, love stories, musicals, thrillers, documentaries, and science fiction shockers played a critical dual role: on the one hand teaching millions of Americans why communism represented the greatest threat their country had ever faced, and on the other selling America&#39;s liberal-capitalist ideas around the globe. Drawing on declassified government documents, studio archives, and filmmakers&#39; private papers, Shaw reveals the different ways in which cinematic propaganda was produced, disseminated, and received by audiences during the Cold War. In the process, he addresses subjects as diverse as women&#39;s fashions, McCarthyism, drug smuggling, Christianity, and American cultural diplomacy in India. Anyone seeking to understand wartime propaganda today will find striking contemporary resonance in his conclusions about Hollywood&#39;s versatility and power.</p><p>Tony Shaw is reader in international history at the University of Hertfordshire."Politically nuanced, historically contextualized, and internationally informed, Hollywood's Cold War is essential reading for anyone interested in this fascinating subject. Tony Shaw's analysis is both penetrating and comprehensive. The broad range of films he studies will greatly expand conventional understandings of the Cold War's impact on American filmmaking."&#x2015;Christian G. Appy, author of <i>Patriots: The Vietnam War Remembered from All Sides </i><br>"This is a complex and rewarding book held together with a coherent argument but not afraid to admit the many-sided possibilities when interpreting cultural products. . . . This is a fine, well-researched work."&#x2015;<i>H-Net Reviews</i><br><br>"A very broad and inclusive history of the interaction between U.S. films and the Cold War, covering the period from 1917 to 1989. Basing his narrative on extensive research, including archival materials, Shaw is objective and analytical in his approach. He deals with a wide variety of genres: documentaries, government, and Hollywood; the repressive atmosphere of the McCarthy era; the Vietnam War; the struggle for civil rights; and government subsidies. The U.S. position during the Cold War influenced and was influenced by Hollywood films. Presidents of both parties, bureaucrats, and security agencies, and military leaders used film to spread pro-American ideas and images, with mixed success. The book has extensive footnotes and an excellent bibliography. Important for political and cultural history. Highly recommended."&#x2015;<i>CHOICE</i><br><br>"A sprightly and very informative volume, which analyzes how Communists and their adversaries were shown on the big screen. Shaw also provides an often intriguing backstory in which particular forces and folks make the artifacts of mass culture that help shape perceptions . . . The extent of Shaw's research in official records and studio files, plus comprehensive trolling of the secondary sources, is bound to satisfy the most exacting standards, but in Hollywood's Cold War he wisely opts for case studies rather than synoptic breadth."&#x2015;<i>Journal of Cold War Studies</i><br><br>"[Shaw] makes a persuasive case. It is abetted by a levelheaded tone, a crisply informative manner, and an approach more concerned with telling a story than grinding an ax."&#x2015;<i>American Historical Review</i><br>"This book makes a significant contribution to the historiography of the Cold War. Shaw makes an excellent case that Cold War was fought culturally, as well as diplomatically, economically, and militarily. . . . It will prove indispensable to anyone considering further research and to those teaching courses on U.S. Cold War cinema."&#x2015;<i>The Historian</i><br><br>"Shaw meticulously researched book, <i>Hollywood's Cold War</i>, investigates the history of the mainstream American film industry's willing collusion with Washington to produce and disseminate anti-Communist entertainment nationally and internationally, while simultaneously marketing American capitalist ideologies to the world."&#x2015;<i>Screening the Past</i></p><h2>Sandwich: A Global History (Edible)</h2><p><p>The humble peanut butter and jelly or bologna and cheese or corned beef on rye&#x2014;no matter your cooking expertise, chances are you&#x2019;ve made and eaten countless sandwiches in your lifetime.

A little more than two miles down a poorly marked one-lane dirt road, the house was better termed a shack&#x2015;it had no electricity or modern plumbing, the roof leaked, and mice had invaded the walls. It was perfect.<br>Sitting on Tisbury Great Pond&#x2015;well-stocked with oysters and crab for foraged dinners&#x2015;the house faced the ocean and the sky, and though it was eventually replaced by a sturdier structure, the ethos remained the same: no heat, no TV, and no telephone. Instead, there were countless hours at the beach, meals cooked and savored with friends, nights talking under the stars, until in 2014, the house was sold.<br><i>To the New Owners</i> is Madeleine Blais&#x2019;s charming, evocative memoir of this house, and of the Vineyard itself&#x2015;from the history of the island and its famous visitors to the ferry, the pie shops, the quirky charms and customs, and the abundant natural beauty. But more than that, this is an elegy for a special place. Many of us have one place that anchors our most powerful memories. For Blais, it was the Vineyard house&#x2015;a retreat and a dependable pleasure that also measured changes in her family. As children were born and grew up, as loved ones aged and passed away, the house was a constant. And now, the house lives on in the hearts of those who cherished it.</p><p><b>Madeleine Blais</b> was a reporter for the <i>Miami Herald</i> for years before joining the faculty of the School of Journalism at the University of Massachusetts. She is the author of <i>In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle</i>, <i>Uphill Walkers</i>, and <i>The Heart Is an Instrument</i>, a collection of her journalism.<br><br>Madeleine Blais lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.What was most vexing to me about selling the house was that the new owners had no idea what they were getting. They saw 5.5 acres, with only a small portion a buildable footprint. They saw the lot and the subdivision numbers by which we were known by the town of West Tisbury, important if it ever had to send a fire engine our way. They saw a roof that needed replacing and the chance to burden us with half the cost ($17,000). They saw a house they might upgrade, a house they might tear down. <p><br>What the new owners could not see, and therefore could not appreciate, was the human history, all the lives that grazed ours and the ones that truly intersected, the noisy arrivals and departures, the arguments and the recipes, the ghosts and the guests, crabs caught and birthdays celebrated, clams shucked, towels shaken, lures assembled, bonfires lit, the dogs we indulged, the ticks we cursed, the pies we consumed, and, through it all, both close by and in the distance, the moving waters (as a poet put it) at their priest-like task. They could not see the depth of the life lived here during the summer for all those years.</p></p><h2>If God Already Knows Why Pray?</h2><p><p> Knowing who God is &#x2013; his character, his plans and why he wants us to pray &#x2013; are essentials in building our understanding of prayer.

She is the chairperson of the linguistics department at Swarthmore College.Grade 9 Up?This retelling of the story of Rapunzel is no simple fairy tale retold for the entertainment of children. Instead, it is a searing commentary on the evil that can result from human longings gone awry. Napoli sets the novel in 16th-century Switzerland and alternates the various characters' points of view. Zel and Count Konrad's narratives are presented in the third person, while Mother tells her own story. All are told in the present tense. Readers learn that the barren mother's obsession for a child drove her to give herself up to eternal damnation in order to have a daughter. Now, she seeks to keep the child away from the world so that the innocent girl will choose her mother above all others. That this will mean Zel's damnation also does not deter Mother in the least. When the inevitable happens and Zel meets the young man, Mother locks her away in a tower. Unlike most versions, this story realistically portrays the dismal effects of isolation on the girl's mind and spirit. She goes quite mad but is still able to accept Konrad's love when he finds her at last. Konrad's transformation from arrogant noble to a man with an obsessive love for a girl he barely knows is less realistic but follows the traditional story line. In his final confrontation with Mother, evil appears to have triumphed. Even the eventual "happily ever after" ending cannot clear the air of the darkness that pervades this tale. Mother's fatal possessiveness and the horror of Zel's life in the tower are the dominant themes that readers will remember. This version, with its Faustian overtones, will challenge readers to think about this old story on a deeper level. It begs for discussion in literature classes.?Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>As Texas Goes...: How the Lone Star State Hijacked the American Agenda</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Gail Collins is the funniest serious political commentator in America.

As such, he is the quintessential subject for the innovative historiography Jan Assmann both defines and practices in this work, the study of historical memory--a study, in this case, of the ways in which factual and fictional events and characters are stored in religious beliefs and transformed in their philosophical justification, literary reinterpretation, philological restitution (or falsification), and psychoanalytic demystification.</p><p>To account for the complexities of the foundational event through which monotheism was established, <i>Moses the Egyptian</i> goes back to the short-lived monotheistic revolution of the Egyptian king Akhenaten (1360-1340 B.C.E.). Assmann traces the monotheism of Moses to this source, then shows how his followers denied the Egyptians any part in the origin of their beliefs and condemned them as polytheistic idolaters. Thus began the cycle in which every "counter-religion," by establishing itself as truth, denounced all others as false. Assmann reconstructs this cycle as a pattern of historical abuse, and tracks its permutations from ancient sources, including the Bible, through Renaissance debates over the basis of religion to Sigmund Freud's <i>Moses and Monotheism</i>. One of the great Egyptologists of our time, and an exceptional scholar of history and literature, Assmann is uniquely equipped for this undertaking--an exemplary case study of the vicissitudes of historical memory that is also a compelling lesson in the fluidity of cultural identity and beliefs.</p></p><p>Jan Assmann is Professor of Egyptology at the University of Heidelberg.&#x201c;A brilliant study...World-renowned as a specialist on Egyptian texts, beliefs, and rituals, Assmann combines great technical virtuosity in his chosen field with wide--very wide--theoretical and comparative interests...Elegantly argued, impressively documented, and written in eloquent English, <i>Moses the Egyptian</i> offers challenging new findings on the early history of monotheism, and a new reading of the place of Egypt in modern Western culture--and it puts both into the larger context of a theory of cultural memory.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Grafton</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;For early writers...Moses invented a religious tradition that was the deliberate antithesis of that of Egypt. Later, in the period treated here...they credited Moses with having instructed the Hebrews in a version of Egyptian religion...This is certainly a fascinating work...This account of the theme of <i>Moses the Egyptian</i> should appeal to students of the time period mostly treated here. Moreover...the volume will serve to introduce any number of students of the Near East to several thinkers who were prominent in their own time but not widely known today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Lorton</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of Near Eastern Studies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Jan Assmann revisits the ground covered by Freud [in <i>Moses and Monotheism</i>], but with important differences. Assmann is no amateur. He is an eminent German Egyptologist, and no one writes with more authority about relations between ancient Egypt and ancient Israel. Equally important, Assmann aspires to something at once more tenable and more valuable than Freud. Freud tried to describe Moses as he really was... Assmann instead chose to write an account of how Moses has been remembered in different times and places... Assmann gives a dazzling account of several centuries of [the Moses-as-Egyptian] tradition...<i>Moses the Egyptian</i>, for all its brilliant erudition, is not simply dispassionate history. It is equally a homily. It is this that makes [it]--so rare for an academic monograph--a profoundly moving book...Assmann argues passionately that we today have much to learn from the ancient Egyptians whom he has spent his life studying...Most moving of all, Assmann is a consummate scholar with courage enough to moralize...Assmann's reconstruction of an ecumenical tradition of interpreting the Exodus is an important contribution to the history of religion. At the same time, his plea that modern theologians adopt similar views has great moral force. Assmann has done nothing less than suggest that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam be set upon different, more inclusive foundations. By demonstrating that these alternate foundations have long been part of the Judeo-Christian tradition, Assmann makes such sweeping reform almost plausible. Plausible or not, Assmann has written a book that is scholarly and passionate, a book that inspires as well as informs.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Noah J. Efron</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<i>Moses the Egyptian</i>'s] scholarly depth lends legitimacy to its revisionist claim. [It is not] designed to ignite controversy in the culture wars--something that cannot be said for some other efforts in the field. This deep seriousness alone is sufficient to recommend Assmann's study. Assmann tells several interlocking stories. His primary narrative line is the memory of Egypt in the European scholarly imagination. Here he attempts--with considerable success--to move beyond a conventional history of scholarship... Assmann moves beyond cultural history to something more subtle: the complex transmission of ideas which are sometimes recorded, sometimes recessive, sometimes almost forgotten. What is striking is not only Assmann's account of the written record of the Moses and Egypt story but his recovery of the reasons for its historical retention...Assmann has produced a learned study whose theses will themselves endure in the scholarly memory.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Peter Kenney</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Historical Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<i>Moses the Egyptian</i>] opens up a question that is crucial to adherents of all three religions that claim their origin in biblical Judaism. That question has to do with the religious distinction between truth and falsehood. It seems natural to a Jew, a Christian or a Muslim to consider his or her own religion true and other religions false. This tendency is especially strong in Christianity. But according to Egyptologist Jan Assman, people who practised the ancient religions we call pagan did not see the world in this way. People of difference nations might worship difference sets of goddesses and gods, but there were alternative expressions of the same underlying reality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bob Chodos</b><b>, </b><b><i>Catholic News Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This very ambitious book keeps its promise...Assmann tells us that he wrote the book as if under a spell. Its readers, too, can feel spellbound...Rather than seeking to cover the whole historical span, Assmann has wisely chosen to focus on some of the major articulations of the Moses/Egypt discourse throughout intellectual and religious history. One hopes that this strategy, which leaves other books to be written, has reopened an inexhaustible well of inquiry.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Guy G. Stroumsa</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of Religion</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One will find in this fascinating book an investigation of 'the history of Europe's remembering Egypt.' Assmann's term for this is 'mnemo-history,' a way of studying the past that is concerned 'not with the past as such, but only with the past as it is remembered.' Assmann serves as a penetrating critic who shows that before the Enlightenment the books on Egypt spoke the language of the Enlightenment. What the scholars and philosophers presented when they described ancient Egyptian religion looked very much like Spinozism, Deism, pantheism, or 'natural religion,' the kinds of religious sensibilities they favored. This is a feature that is no less apparent today than it was two hundred years ago.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Louis Wilken</b><b>, </b><b><i>First Things</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this remarkable book, Assmann takes the very essence of Western religion--the principle of monotheism--as his topic, tracing its effects by looking at its counter-image in the Western imagination--the memory of Egypt...Based on his intimate and profound knowledge of ancient Egyptian religion, Assmann is able to construct a new image of the contrast between Egypt and monotheism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ronald Hendel</b><b>, </b><b><i>Biblical Archaeology Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a gripping and richly documented response to Y. H. Yerushalmi's tracing of <i>Freud's Moses</i> to Schiller, John Spencer, Strabo, Celsus, Apion and Manetho, and a development of Assmann's earlier complementary attempt to link Akhenaten's religious revolution with the story of the reception of the memory of Moses via a similar chain of classical, mediaeval, renaissance and enlightenment authors by Schiller and Freud.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>G. Glazov</b><b>, </b><b><i>Society for Old Testament Study</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Assmann's story is as good an explanation of this history as anyone has come up with, and it must be based on a firmer foundation than anyone else's could be. It is tantalizing and inviting. No one can fault him on his scholarship or erudition. He is one of the most talented historians of the Ancient world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Saul Friedlander</b></p><h2>Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism: Religious Identity and National Socialism</h2><p>Derek Hastings here illuminates an important and largely overlooked aspect of early Nazi history, going back to the years after World War I--when National Socialism first emerged--to reveal its close early ties with Catholicism. Although an antagonistic relationship between the Catholic Church and Hitler&#39;s regime developed later during the Third Reich, the early Nazi movement was born in Munich, a city whose population was overwhelmingly Catholic. Focusing on Munich and the surrounding area, Hastings shows how Catholics played a central and hitherto overlooked role in the Nazi movement before the 1923 Beerhall Putsch. He examines the activism of individual Catholic writers, university students, and priests and the striking Catholic-oriented appeals and imagery formulated by the movement. He then discusses why the Nazis embarked on a different path following the party&#39;s reconstitution in early 1925, ultimately taking on an increasingly anti-Catholic and anti-Christian identity.</p><p><br><strong>Derek Hastings</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at Oakland University.<br><br>"Sometimes good things come in strange packages.

This is the first volume to explore Vuillard's rich and varied career in its totality, presenting nearly 350 works that demonstrate the full range of his subject matter and reveal both the public and private sides of this quintessentially Parisian artist.<br>In a series of illustrated essays and catalogue entries, the authors explore Vuillard's complex and diverse artistic development, beginning with his academic training in Paris in the late 1880s and the innovative Nabi paintings of the 1890s for which he is best known, including his provocative, disquieting middle-class interiors and his work associated with the avant-garde theatre. The authors also examine Vuillard's splendid but lesser known large-scale decorations, his luminous landscapes, and the elegant portraits from the last decades of his career. In addition to paintings, the volume includes a substantial selection of drawings and graphics, together with a large group of striking photographs by the artist, many of which are published here for the first time.<br>This illustrated catalogue accompanies the most comprehensive exhibition ever devoted to the work of Edouard Vuillard (1868-1940). The exhibition opens at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and travels to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Galeries nationales du Grand Palais in Paris, and the Royal Academy of Arts, London.</p><p>A quiet man who lived with his beloved mother, the painter �douard Vuillard applied his inventive talents to re-imagining bourgeois interiors as shifting planes of color and pattern. Admirers of his sensuous interior world will be bowled over by this sumptuous volume with its vivid narrative and 463 exquisite color reproductions. In <i>�douard Vuillard</i>, Guy Cogeval discusses the artist's life and work with a passionate involvement that is rare in contemporary art writing. He describes how Vuillard's early work as a set designer apparently led him to stage manage family members, placing them in tense or confrontational tableaux that he memorialized in paint. Vuillard was an enthusiastic amateur photographer who favored the new handheld Kodak camera. An entire chapter is dedicated to the artist's charmingly artless snapshots of family and friends. In his later years, Vuillard utilized a more down-to-earth painting style in portraits of the rich and famous. While these paintings are often dismissed as conservative, Cogeval points out Vuillard's use of subtle details to comment on some of his sitters. Four other essayists treat themes ranging from "Vuillard and Ambiguity" to the effect of his annual summer vacations on his treatment of landscape, light and composition.

This introduction to abstract algebra is designed to make the study of all required topics and the reading and writing of proofs both accessible and enjoyable for students encountering the subject for the first time.Preface to the Second Edition <p> I was reluctant to accept Prentice Hall's offer to write a second edition of this book. When I wrote the first edition several years ago, I assumed the usual assumption: All first courses in algebra have essentially the same material, and so it is not necessary to ask what is in such a book, but rather how it is in it. I think that most people accept this axiom, at least tacitly, and so their books are almost all clones of one another, differing only in the quality of the writing. Looking at the first version of my book, I now see many flaws; there were some interesting ideas in it, but the book was not significantly different from others. I could improve the text I had written, but I saw no reason to redo it if I were to make only cosmetic changes. </p><p> I then thought more carefully about what an introduction to algebra ought to be. When Birkhoff and Mac Lane wrote their pioneering A Survey of Modern Algebra about 60 years ago, they chose the topics that they believed were most important, both for students with a strong interest in algebra and those with other primary interests in which algebraic ideas and methods are used. Birkhoff and Mac Lane were superb mathematicians, and they chose the topics for their book very well. Indeed, their excellent choice of topics is what has led to the clone producing assumption I have mentioned above. But times have changed; indeed, Mac Lane himself has written a version of A Survey of Modern Algebra from a categorical point of view. I feel it is too early to mention categories explicitly in this book, for I believe one learns from the particular to the general, but categories are present implicitly in the almost routine way homomorphisms are introduced as soon as possible after introducing algebraic systems. Whereas emphasis on rings and groups is still fundamental, there are today major directions which either did not exist in 1940 or were not then recognized to be so important. These new directions involve algebraic geometry, computers, homology, and representations. One may view this new edition as the first of a two volume sequence. This book, the first volume, is designed for students beginning their study of algebra. The sequel, designed for beginning graduate students, is designed to be independent of this one. Hence, the sequel will have a substantial overlap with this book, but it will go on to discuss some of the basic results which lead to the most interesting contemporary topics. Each generation should survey algebra to make it serve the present time. </p><p> When I was writing this second edition, I was careful to keep the pace of the exposition at its original level; one should not rush at the beginning. Besides rewriting and rearranging theorems, examples, and exercises that were present in the first edition, I have added new material. For example, there is a short subsection on euclidean rings which contains a proof of Fermat's Two-Squares Theorem; and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory is stated and used to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: the complex numbers are algebraically closed. </p><p> I have also added two new chapters, one with more group theory and one with more commutative rings, so that the book is now more suitable for a one-year course (one can also base a one-semester course on the first three chapters). The new chapter on groups proves the Sylow theorems, the Jordan Holder theorem, and the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, and it introduces free groups and presentations by generators and relations. The new chapter on rings discusses prime and maximal ideals, unique factorization in polynomial rings in several variables, noetherian rings, varieties, and Grobner bases. Finally, a new section contains hints for most of the exercises (and an instructor's solution manual contains complete solutions for all the exercises in the first four chapters). </p><p> In addition to thanking again those who helped me with the first edition, it is a pleasure to thank Daniel D. Anderson, Aldo Brigaglia, E. Graham Evans, Daniel Flath, William Haboush, Dan Grayson, Christopher Heil, Gerald J. Janusz, Jennifer D. Key, Steven L. Kleiman, Emma Previato, Juan Jorge Schaffer, and Thomas M. Songer for their valuable suggestions for this book. </p><p> And so here is edition two; my hope is that it makes modern algebra accessible to beginners, and that it will make its readers want to pursue algebra further. </p><p> Joseph J. Rotman</p></p><h2>Prehistoric Cannibalism at Mancos 5MTUMR-2346 (Princeton Legacy Library, 132)</h2><p><p>Cannibalism is one of the oldest and most emotionally charged topics in anthropological literature. Tim White's analysis of human bones from an Anasazi pueblo in southwestern Colorado, site 5MTUMR-2346, reveals that nearly thirty men, women, and children were butchered and cooked there around A.D. 1100. Their bones were fractured for marrow, and the remains discarded in several rooms of the pueblo. By comparing the human skeletal remains with those of animals used for food at other sites, the author analyzes evidence for skinning, dismembering, cooking, and fracturing to infer that cannibalism took place at Mancos. As White evaluates claims for cannibalism in ethnographic and archaeological contexts worldwide, he describes how cultural biases can often distort the interpretation of scientific data. This book applies and introduces anatomical, taphonomic, zooarchaeological, and forensic methods in the investigation of prehistoric human behavior. It is an important example of how we can exchange opinion for knowledge. "Cannibalism is a controversial topic because many people do not want to believe that their prehistoric ancestors engaged in such activity, but they will be hard put to reject this meticulous study."--Kent V. Flannery, University of Michigan "This is the best piece of detailed research yet to appear that seeks to put in place a body of justified knowledge and a procedure for its use in making inferences about the past. No student of bones can ignore this work."--Lewis R. Binford, University of New Mexico "This could be one of the most important books in archaeology written in the last decade."--James F. O'Connell, University of Utah "Paleontologists and zooarchaeologists, archaeologists and physical anthropologists, taphonomists, and forensic scientists should all read this work. Quite frankly, I think this will become one of the most important books of the 1990s..."--R. Lee Lyman, University of Missouri-Columbia</p><p>Originally published in 1992.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

[This book] will prove a major influence on those who analyze bone assemblages, whatever their provenance and origin, for years to come."

Both species were known to be in serious decline by the end of the nineteenth century and are likely extinct today, though occasional reports of sightings persist. While the Ivory-billed was one of the first endangered birds to receive intensive conservation attention, the efforts were too often misdirected, and too little, too late. Concern for the fate of the Imperial Woodpecker came even later and resulted in a similar fate. </p><p>The probable extinction of two of North America's largest and most charismatic birds has much to teach us regarding conservation efforts, especially as many other species face similar problems. In closely examining the history of the decline and causes of extinction of the Ivory-billed and Imperial Woodpeckers, the authors offer explanations for the birds' demise and strategies for future conservation and research efforts that focus mainly on the deadly, though largely understated, role of human depredations.</p></p><p>The long, sad story of the failure of efforts to prevent the extinction of two of nature&#39;s most impressive woodpeckers offers lessons for preventing the extinctions of other species.Noel F.

Although understanding has increased in virtually all other areas of grief and loss, chronic sorrow has received scant attention. <em>Chronic sorrow</em> is a natural grief reaction to losses that are not final, but continue to be present in the life of the griever. This book views chronic sorrow in a life-span perspective, and reveals the effect on the griever and the people close to them.<br><br>This book fills a void in the literature; and attempts to develop a comprehensive analysis of chronic sorrow that will secure its position within the field of grief and loss.<br><br></p><p><strong>Susan Roos, Ph.D.,</strong> is a psychotherapist who has been in private practice for over twenty years. She is a licensed social worker, a board certifed diplomate and a Gestalt therapist.&#34;Susan Roos has written a comprehensive and important book regarding the little understood phenomenon of chronic sorrow. She has compiled reams of research and her own observations as a therapist into a detailed, analytical, pioneering work. Her experiences as a mother of two developmentally disabled daughters, one who died at the age of 3, seem to be the foundation and the cement for this work. Roos has crafted a volume that needs to be read by clinicians and medical professionals. ppIt is my hope that the author has plans to write another book geared specifically toward parents and caretakers experiencing other-loss. This book is appropriate for professionals...Undoubtedly, further research will be spurred by Roos&#39;s important addition to the field of grief and the concept of chronic sorrow. She has made an immense contribution to those experiencing self-loss and other loss, from which many will benefit.&#34; -- Debra Thompson, Death Studies, April 2003</p><h2>Sicily: Art and Invention between Greece and Rome</h2><p>Ancient Sicily, a prosperous island at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, occupied a pivotal place between Greece, North Africa, and the Italian peninsula. In the late eighth century B.C., �migr�s from the Greek mainland founded colonies along the shores of the region they knew as Sikelia, bringing with them the dialects, customs, and religious practices of their homelands. Dearest of all lands to Demeter, goddess of the harvest, Sicily grew wealthy from its agricultural abundance, and colonial settlements emerged as formidable metropolises.<br><br><i>Sicily: Art and Invention between Greece and Rome</i> is the only English-language book that focuses on the watershed period between the victory over the Carthaginians at the Battle of Himera in 480 B.C. and the Roman conquest of Syracuse in 212 B.C., a time of great social and political ferment. Intended as a sourcebook for Classical and Hellenistic Sicily, this anthology features current research by more than forty international scholars. The essays investigate Sicily not simply as a destination for adventurers and settlers, but as a catalyst that shaped Greek culture at its peak and transmitted Hellenism to Rome. In the opulent courts of the Sicilian city-states, artists, poets, and scientists attained levels of refinement and ingenuity rivaling, even surpassing, those of &#x201c;old Greece.&#x201d; Innovation in architecture, engineering, coinage, philosophy, and literature flourished in mixed cultural communities, which offered room for experimentation and gave birth to such influential figures as Empedokles, Theokritos, and Archimedes.<br><br>This volume accompanies the exhibition <i>Sicily: Art and Invention between Greece and Rome</i>, presented at the J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Villa (April 3&#x2013; August 19, 2013), the Cleveland Museum of Art (September 30, 2013&#x2013;January 5, 2014), and the Palazzo Ajutamicristo in Palermo (February 14&#x2013;June 15, 2014).<br></p><p>Claire L.

Bush and the End of the Cold War</h2><p><b>Based on unprecedented access to previously&nbsp;classified&nbsp;documents and dozens of interviews with key policymakers, here is the untold story of how&nbsp;George H. W. Bush faced a critical turning point of history&#x2014;the end of the Cold War.</b><br><br> The end of the Cold War was the greatest shock to international affairs since World War II. In that perilous moment, Saddam Hussein chose to invade Kuwait, China cracked down on its own pro-democracy protesters, and regimes throughout Eastern Europe teetered between democratic change and new authoritarians. Not since FDR in 1945 had a U.S. president faced such opportunities and challenges.<br><br>As the presidential historian Jeffrey Engel reveals in this page-turning history, behind closed doors from the Oval Office to the Kremlin, George H. W. Bush rose to the occasion brilliantly. Distrusted by such key allies as Margaret Thatcher and dismissed as&nbsp;too cautious by the press, Bush had the experience and the wisdom to use personal, one-on-one diplomacy with world leaders. Bush knew when it was essential to rally a coalition to push Iraq out of Kuwait.&nbsp;He managed to help unify Germany while strengthening NATO. Based on unprecedented access to previously classified documents and interviews with all of the principals, <i>When the World Seemed New</i> is a riveting, fly-on-the-wall account of a president with his hand on the tiller, guiding the nation through a pivotal time and setting the stage for the twenty-first century.</p><p>JEFFREY A.

Trump."&nbsp; --<i>The New York Times</i></li><li><i></i></li><li>"Engel's "When the World Seemed New" is a fine, often stirring account of these times...The book is at its best when it juxtaposes&nbsp;disparate events: Mr. Bush calibrating the distinctions between a pro-democracy protest in Budapest and another in Beijing; Mr. Gorbachev arriving in Beijing just a month before the crackdown ("the last thing the Chinese leadership needed at that moment"); students in Tiananmen shouting 'Where is our Gorbachev?'"&nbsp; "An absorbing book."&nbsp; --<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></li><li><i></i></li><li>"By far the most comprehensive--and compelling--account of these dramatic years thus far is Jeffrey Engel's <i>When the World Seemed New</i>."&nbsp; <i>-- The National Interest</i></li><li></li><li>"<i>When the World Seemed New</i> is a remarkable book about a remarkable person.&nbsp; Southern Methodist University professor Jeffrey Engel describes in engrossing detail the patient and sophisticated strategy President George H.W.

With the advent of new technologies, new media, and the dispersion of human agency through external information sources, rhetoric can no longer remain tied to the autonomy of human will and cognition as the sole determinants in the discursive act.<br> <br> Rickert develops the concept of ambience in order to engage all of the elements that comprise the ecologies in which we exist. Culling from Martin Heidegger&#x2019;s hermeneutical phenomenology in <i>Being and Time,</i> Rickert finds the basis for ambience in Heidegger&#x2019;s assertion that humans do not exist in a vacuum; there is a constant and fluid relation to the material, informational, and emotional spaces in which they dwell. Hence, humans are not the exclusive actors in the rhetorical equation; agency can be found in innumerable things, objects, and spaces. As Rickert asserts, it is only after we become attuned to these influences that rhetoric can make a first step toward sufficiency.<br> <br> Rickert also recalls the foundational Greek philosophical concepts of <i>kairos</i> (time), <i>chora</i> (space/place), and <i>periechon</i> (surroundings) and cites their repurposing by modern and postmodern thinkers as &#x201c;informational scaffolding&#x201d; for how we reason, feel, and act. He discusses contemporary theory in cognitive science, rhetoric, and object-oriented philosophy to expand his argument for the essentiality of ambience to the field of rhetoric. Rickert then examines works of ambient music that incorporate natural and artificial sound, spaces, and technologies, finding them to be exemplary of a more fully resonant and experiential media.<br> <br> In his preface, Rickert compares ambience to the fermenting of wine&#x2014;how its distinctive flavor can be traced to innumerable factors, including sun, soil, water, region, and grape variety. The environment and company with whom it&#x2019;s consumed further enhance the taste experience. And so it should be with rhetoric&#x2014;to be considered among all of its influences. As Rickert demonstrates, the larger world that we inhabit (and that inhabits us) must be fully embraced if we are to advance as beings and rhetors within it.</p></p><p><b>Thomas Rickert</b> is associate professor of English at Purdue University and author of <i>Acts of Enjoyment: Rhetoric, Zizek, and the Return of the Subject,</i> winner of the 2007 JAC Gary A.

But the situations, settings, attitudes, and opinions in its pages, as well as the details of narcotrafficking and the anti-narcotics effort, are as accurate as careful research and personal acquaintance can make them. The drug war in Bolivia is an ongoing drama of real people in a context of greed and addiction, unimaginable wealth and economic hardship, conflicting political ideologies, right and wrong motives--and of occasional simple heroism as well. CrossFire is the story of that drama. <p>But beyond the political and literary value of the book, CrossFire carries a message that touches all our deepest longings. A message of a loving Creator God who yearns over His children who have lost their way, calling for them to return to Him. What do you do when you hit rock-bottom and God seems a universe away? Do you run towards Him--or away?</p>As the child of missionary parents, Jeanette Windle grew up in the rural towns of Colombia, which are now guerrilla hot zones.

It presents a series of exercises and journaling experiences within an active and inquiring learning model. Self-directed, collaborative learning built upon reader&#39;s diverse strengths, abilities, and experience is the focus of this approach. Through this active learning process users become more independent and gain confidence in their ability to think, ask, and reflect about, as well as plan, analyze, and apply experiences. As an active learning guide, this book has three primary goals: to emphasize the need to integrate theoretical learning with the skills acquired in the clinical setting, to encourage individuals to fully participate in the process, and to provide a practical guide to the triumphs and pitfalls along the way.</p><p>Associate Professor of Nursing at the University of Calgary.</p><h2>Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and the Unified Process (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p></p><blockquote>&#x201c;This edition contains Larman&#x2019;s usual accurate and thoughtful writing.

These case studies incrementally introduce key skills, essential OO principles and patterns, UML notation, and best practices.

It's designed to teach you to think of software as a collection of objects with properties and to manipulate the relationships between them. This is far more profound.</p><p> The case study enables Craig Larman to carry the design through to Java code. In practice, you will need a basic understanding of OO programming to benefit from <i>Applying UML and Patterns</i>, though you needn't know Java--you can implement the designs in the OO language of your choice with equal facility.</p><p> When it comes right down to it, <i>Applying UML and Patterns</i> is all about providing you with a language in which to think about software design. This is quite different from learning a language in which to code a design.</p><p> A facility with OOA/D will enable you to design and discuss programs independent of code, to produce more elegant and maintainable software, and to take a 30,000-foot view of the way your software interacts with the world. In effect, it can shift your viewpoint from that of a mechanic to that more sophisticated viewpoint of an engineer. Recommended. <i>--Steve Patient.

For many, it involves dramatic changes of everyday routines and personal habits. <br><br>Davidman bases her analysis on in-depth conversations with forty ex-Hasidic individuals. From these conversations emerge accounts of the great fear, angst, and sense of danger that come of leaving a highly bounded enclave community. Many of those interviewed spoke of feeling marginal in their own communities; of strain in their homes due to death, divorce, or their parents' profound religious differences; experienced sexual, physical, or verbal abuse; or expressed an acute awareness of gender inequality, the dissimilar lives of their secular relatives, and forbidden television shows, movies, websites, and books. <br><br><em>Becoming Un-Orthodox</em> draws much-needed attention to the vital role of the body and bodily behavior in religious practices. It is through physical rituals and routines that the members of a religion, particularly a highly conservative one, constantly create, perform, and reinforce the culture of the religion. Because of the many observances and daily rituals required by their faith, Hasidic defectors are an exemplary case study for exploring the centrality of the body in shaping, maintaining, and shedding religions. <br><br>This book provides both a moving narrative of the struggles of Hasidic defectors and a compelling call for greater collective understanding of the complex significance of the body in society.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lynn Davidman</strong> is the Beren Distinguished Professor of Modern Jewish Studies and Professor of Sociology at the University of Kansas.

Why are men still far more likely than women to earn degrees in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics? And why are men on average more likely to be injured in accidents and fights than women? These and many other questions are the subject of both informal investigation in the media and formal investigation in academic and scientific circles. In his landmark book Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences, author David Geary provided the first comprehensive evolutionary model to explain human sex differences. Using the principles of sexual selection such as female choice and male-male competition, the author systematically reviewed and discussed the evolution of sex differences and their expression throughout the animal kingdom, as a means of not just describing but explaining the same process in Homo sapiens. Now, over ten years since the first edition, Geary has completed a massive update, expansion and theoretical revision of his classic text.</p><p></p><h2>Mi Abuela Fumaba Puros/My Grandma Smoked Cigars</h2><p>In this bilingual edition, utilizing the author/child point of view, Ulibarri reveals the memorable experiences of a child in rural, mountainous New Mexico.

Throughout, the book features comparisons between concrete elements such as creedal statements, prayer texts, and writings from major theologians and mystics. It also includes a glossary of technical theological terms. For western readers in particular, this balanced, authoritative work overturns some common stereotypes about Islam, especially those that have emerged in the decade since September 11, 2001.</p><p>"John Renard presents a judicious overview of Muslim and Christian ways of 'being in the world.'

Yet despite a 1988 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art and a huge influence on a younger generation of art photographers, he remains underappreciated by the general public. Hopefully, this lavish publication, concentrating on his most important body of work, the street scenes, will begin to change that. Winogrand took the workaday street tableau and revealed there an intensity and humanity as clear as in any image in a museum. The majority of the 107 photos capture New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and they now serve the purpose of a time capsule. But more than that they evoke a timeless spirit of individual alive in the city.

This volume emphasizes developing analytical and writing skills in the contrapuntal technique of the eighteenth century. The orientation is strongly stylistic, dealing mainly with the polyphony of the late Baroque period. Three aspects are stressed throughout: practical work in writing counterpoint, utilizing various textures, devices, and genre of the period; historical background, to establish the origins of different forms and justify the pedagogical method employed here; analysis of selections from music literature, often in voice-leading reductions. After an opening chapter that reviews some general features of the late Baroque period, there is a brief survey of melodic characteristics, and a study of procedures associated with two, three, and four voices.</p><p>Title of related interest from Waveland Press: Robert Gauldin, A Practical Approach to 16th-Century Counterpoint (ISBN 9780881338522)."The new edition is comprehensive and detailed with effective step-by-step analysis and guidance.

No longer dwarfed by his boss's prestige and knowledge, Enzo begins to fantasize about being in charge. Unlocking a secret cabinet "filled with mysterious potions," Enzo begins to play out his most ambitious fantasies. The conniving fellow tests one particular concoction on Chip, the professor's beloved guinea pig, and gets his just--and hilarious--deserts. These wild, unusually detailed illustrations boast broad caricatures worthy of Punch. Older children especially will relish the baroque humor as they pore over the pictures' myriad zany touches.

Why does the past affect the future and not the other way around? What does quantum mechanics really tell us about the world? In this important and accessible book, Huw Price throws fascinating new light on some of the great mysteries of modern physics, and connects them in a wholly original way.<br> Price begins with the mystery of the arrow of time. Why, for example, does disorder always increase, as required by the second law of thermodynamics? Price shows that, for over a century, most physicists have thought about these problems the wrong way. Misled by the human perspective from within time, which distorts and exaggerates the differences between past and future, they have fallen victim to what Price calls the "double standard fallacy": proposed explanations of the difference between the past and the future turn out to rely on a difference which has been slipped in at the beginning, when the physicists themselves treat the past and future in different ways. To avoid this fallacy, Price argues, we need to overcome our natural tendency to think about the past and the future differently. We need to imagine a point outside time -- an Archimedean "view from nowhen" -- from which to observe time in an unbiased way.<br> Offering a lively criticism of many major modern physicists, including Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking, Price shows that this fallacy remains common in physics today -- for example, when contemporary cosmologists theorize about the eventual fate of the universe. The "big bang" theory normally assumes that the beginning and end of the universe will be very different. But if we are to avoid the double standard fallacy, we need to consider time symmetrically, and take seriously the possibility that the arrow of time may reverse when the universe recollapses into a "big crunch."<br> Price then turns to the greatest mystery of modern physics, the meaning of quantum theory. He argues that in missing the Archimedean viewpoint, modern physics has missed a radical and attractive solution to many of the apparent paradoxes of quantum physics. Many consequences of quantum theory appear counterintuitive, such as Schrodinger's Cat, whose condition seems undetermined until observed, and Bell's Theorem, which suggests a spooky "nonlocality," where events happening simultaneously in different places seem to affect each other directly. Price shows that these paradoxes can be avoided by allowing that at the quantum level the future does, indeed, affect the past. This demystifies nonlocality, and supports Einstein's unpopular intuition that quantum theory describes an objective world, existing independently of human observers: the Cat is alive or dead, even when nobody looks. So interpreted, Price argues, quantum mechanics is simply the kind of theory we ought to have expected in microphysics -- from the symmetric standpoint.<br><em>Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point</em> presents an innovative and controversial view of time and contemporary physics. In this exciting book, Price urges physicists, philosophers, and anyone who has ever pondered the mysteries of time to look at the world from the fresh perspective of Archimedes' Point and gain a deeper understanding of ourselves, the universe around us, and our own place in time.<br></p><p><br><strong>Huw Price</strong> is Reader in Philosophy at the University of Sydney, Australia.

Keane </i></p><p><p>Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), known as the father of Russian literature, was descended from Russian nobility and from an African great-grandfather raised at the court of Peter the Great. Pushkin&#x2019;s commitment to social reform resulted in government censorship of his work and a period of exile. He died after a fighting a duel at the age of thirty-seven.</p>i.<br><br>a sergeant of the guards<br> He would have been a Captain in the Guards tomorrow.<br> &#x201c;I do not care for that; a common soldier let him be.&#x201d;<br> A splendid thing to say! He&#x2019;ll have much sorrow... <br> .....<br> Who is his father, then?<br><br>-- knyazhnin<br>My father, Andrey Petrovich Grinyov, had in his youth served under Count M�nnich and retired with the rank of first major in the year 17&#x2014;-. From that time onward he lived on his estate in the province of Simbirsk, where he married Avdotya Vassilyevna U., daughter of a poor landowner of the district. There had been nine of us. All my brothers and sisters died in infancy. Through the kindness of Prince B., our near relative, who was a major of the Guards, I was registered as sergeant in the Semyonovsky regiment. I was supposed to be on leave until I had completed my studies. Our bringing--up in those days was very different from what it is now. At the age of five I was entrusted to the groom Savelyich, who was assigned to look after me, as a reward for the sobriety of his behavior. Under his supervision I had learned, by the age of twelve, to read and write Russian, and could judge very soundly the points of a borzoi dog. At that time my father hired for me a Frenchman, Monsieur Beaupr�, who was fetched from Moscow together with a year&#x2019;s supply of wine and olive oil. Savelyich very much disliked his coming.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The child, thank heaven, has his face washed and his hair combed, and his food given him,&#x201d; he grumbled to himself. &#x201c;Much good it is to spend money on the Frenchman, as though the master hadn&#x2019;t enough servants of his own on the estate!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In his native land Beaupr� had been a hairdresser; afterward he was a soldier in Prussia, and then came to Russia pour �tre outchitel,* without clearly understanding the meaning of that word. He was a good fellow, but extremely thoughtless and flighty. His chief weakness was his passion for the fair sex; his attentions were often rewarded by blows, which made him groan for hours. Besides, &#x201c;he was not an enemy of the bottle,&#x201d; as he put it; that is, he liked to take a drop too much. But since wine was only served in our house at dinner, and then only one glass to each person, and the tutor was generally passed over, my Beaupr� soon grew accustomed to the Russian homemade brandy and, indeed, came to prefer it to the wines of his own country as being far better for the digestion. We made friends at once, and although he was supposed by the agreement to teach me &#x201c;French, German, and all subjects,&#x201d; he preferred to pick up some Russian from me and, after that, we each followed our own pursuits. We got on together capitally. I wished for no other mentor. But fate soon parted us, and this was how it happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> The laundress, Palashka, a stout pock--marked girl, and the dairymaid, one--eyed Akulka, had agreed to throw themselves together at my mother&#x2019;s feet, confessing their culpable weakness and tearfully complaining of the mossoo who had seduced their innocence. My mother did not like to trifle with such things and complained to my father. My father was not one to lose time. He sent at once for that rascal, the Frenchman. They told him mossoo was giving me my lesson. My father went to my room. At that time Beaupr� was sleeping the sleep of innocence on the bed; I was usefully employed. I ought to mention that a map of the world had been ordered for me from Moscow. It hung on the wall; no use was made of it, and I had long felt tempted by its width and thickness. I decided to make a kite of it and, taking advantage of Beaupr�&#x2019;s slumbers, set to work upon it. My father came in just at the moment when I was fixing a tail of tow to the Cape of Good Hope. Seeing my exercises in geography, my father pulled me by the ear, then ran up to Beaupr�, roused him none too gently, and overwhelmed him with reproaches. Covered with confusion, Beaupr� tried to get up but could not: the unfortunate Frenchman was dead drunk. He paid all scores at once: my father lifted him off the bed by the collar, kicked him out of the room, and sent him away that same day, to the indescribable joy of Savelyich. This was the end of my education.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was allowed to run wild, and spent my time chasing pigeons and playing leap--frog with the boys on the estate. Meanwhile I had turned sixteen. Then there came a change in my life.<br> &nbsp;<br> One autumn day my mother was making jam with honey in the drawing room, and I licked my lips as I looked at the boiling scum. My father sat by the window reading the Court Calendar, which he received every year. This book always had a great effect on him: he never read it without agitation, and the perusal of it invariably stirred his bile. My mother, who knew all his ways by heart, always tried to stow the unfortunate book as far away as possible, and sometimes the Court Calendar did not catch his eye for months. When, however, he did chance to find it, he would not let it out of his hands for hours. And so my father was reading the Court Calendar, shrugging his shoulders from time to time and saying in an undertone: &#x201c;Lieutenant--General!... He was a sergeant in my company... a Companion of two Russian Orders!... And it isn&#x2019;t long since he and I...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At last my father threw the Calendar on the sofa, and sank into a thoughtfulness which boded nothing good.<br> &nbsp;<br> He suddenly turned to my mother: &#x201c;Avdotya Vassilyevna, how old is Petrusha?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He is going on seventeen,&#x201d; my mother answered. &#x201c;Petrusha was born the very year when Auntie Nastasya Gerasimovna lost her eye and when...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; my father interrupted her; &#x201c;it is time he went into the service. He has been running about the servant--girls&#x2019; quarters and climbing dovecotes long enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother was so overwhelmed at the thought of parting from me that she dropped the spoon into the saucepan and tears flowed down her cheeks. My delight, however, could hardly be described. The idea of military service was connected in my mind with thoughts of freedom and of the pleasures of Petersburg life. I imagined myself as an officer of the Guards, which, to my mind, was the height of human bliss.<br> &nbsp;<br> My father did not like to change his plans or to put them off. The day for my departure was fixed. On the eve of it my father said that he intended sending with me a letter to my future chief, and asked for paper and a pen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget, Andrey Petrovich, to send my greetings to Prince B.,&#x201d; said my mother, &#x201c;and to tell him that I hope he will be kind to Petrusha.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What nonsense!&#x201d; my father answered, with a frown. &#x201c;Why should I write to Prince B.?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why, you said you were going to write to Petrusha&#x2019;s chief.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, what of it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But Petrusha&#x2019;s chief is Prince B., to be sure. Petrusha is registered in the Semyonovsky regiment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Registered! What do I care about it? Petrusha is not going to Petersburg. What would he learn if he did his service there? To be a spendthrift and a rake? No, let him serve in the army and learn the routine of it and know the smell of powder and be a soldier and not a fop! Registered in the Guards! Where is his passport? Give it to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother found my passport, which she kept put away in a chest together with my christening robe, and, with a trembling hand, gave it to my father. My father read it attentively, put it before him on the table, and began his letter.<br> I was consumed by curiosity. Where was I being sent if not to Petersburg? I did not take my eyes off my father&#x2019;s pen, which moved rather slowly. At last he finished, sealed the letter in the same envelope with the passport, took off his spectacles, called me and said: &#x201c;Here is a letter for you to Andrey Karlovich R., my old friend and comrade. You are going to Orenburg to serve under him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And so all my brilliant hopes were dashed to the ground! Instead of the gay Petersburg life, boredom in a distant and wild part of the country awaited me. Going into the army, of which I had thought with such delight only a moment before, now seemed to me a dreadful misfortune. But it was no use protesting! Next morning a traveling chaise drove up to the house; my bag, a box with tea things, and bundles of pies and rolls, the last tokens of family affection, were packed into it. My parents blessed me. My father said to me: &#x201c;Good-bye, Pyotr. Carry out faithfully your oath of allegiance; obey your superiors; don&#x2019;t seek their favor; don&#x2019;t put yourself forward, and do not shirk your duty; remember the saying: &#x2018;Watch over your clothes while they are new, and over your honor while you are young.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother admonished me with tears to take care of myself, and bade Savelyich look after &#x201c;the child.&#x201d; They dressed me in a hareskin jacket and a fox--fur overcoat. I stepped into the chaise with Savelyich and set off on my journey, weeping bitterly.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the evening I arrived at Simbirsk, where I was to spend the next day in order to buy the things I needed; Savelyich was entrusted with the purchase of them. I put up at an inn. Savel-yich went out shopping early in the morning. Bored with looking out of the window into the dirty street, I wandered about the inn. Coming into the billiard room I saw a tall man of about thirty--five, with a long black mustache, in a dressing--gown, a billiard cue in his hand, and a pipe in his mouth. He was playing with the marker, who drank a glass of vodka on winning and crawled under the billiard table on all fours when he lost. I watched their game. The longer it continued, the oftener the marker had to go on all fours, till at last he remained under the table altogether. The gentleman pronounced some expressive sentences by way of a funeral oration and asked me to have a game. I refused, saying I could not play. This seemed to strike him as strange. He looked at me with something like pity; nevertheless, we entered into conversation. I learned that his name was Ivan Ivanovich Zurin, that he was captain of a Hussar regiment, that he had come to Simbirsk to receive recruits, and was staying at the inn. Zurin invited me to share his dinner, such as it was, like a fellow--soldier. I readily agreed. We sat down to dinner. Zurin drank a great deal and treated me, saying that I must get used to army ways; he told me military anecdotes, which made me rock with laughter, and we got up from the table on the best of terms. Then he offered to teach me to play billiards.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is quite essential to us soldiers,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;On a march, for instance, one comes to some wretched little place; what is one to do? One can&#x2019;t be always beating Jews, you know. So there is nothing for it but to go to the inn and play billiards; and to do that one must be able to play!&#x201d;<br></p><h2>Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War</h2><p>At the start of the Civil War, Knoxville, Tennessee, with a population of just over 4,000, was considered a prosperous metropolis little reliant on slavery. Although the surrounding countryside was predominantly Unionist in sympathy, Knoxville itself was split down the middle, with Union and Confederate supporters even holding simultaneous political rallies at opposite ends of the town's main street. Following Tennessee's secession, Knoxville soon became famous (or infamous) as a stronghold of stalwart Unionism, thanks to the efforts of a small cadre who persisted in openly denouncing the Confederacy. Throughout the course of the Civil War, Knoxville endured military occupation for all but three days, hosting Confederate troops during the first half of the conflict and Union forces throughout the remainder, with the transition punctuated by an extended siege and bloody battle during which nearly forty thousand soldiers fought over the town.<br> <br> In <em>Lincolnites and Rebels</em>, Robert Tracy McKenzie tells the story of Civil War Knoxville-a perpetually occupied, bitterly divided Southern town where neighbor fought against neighbor. Mining a treasure-trove of manuscript collections and civil and military records, McKenzie reveals the complex ways in which allegiance altered the daily routine of a town gripped in a civil war within the Civil War and explores the agonizing personal decisions that war made inescapable. Following the course of events leading up to the war, occupation by Confederate and then Union soldiers, and the troubled peace that followed the war, <em>Lincolnites and Rebels</em> details in microcosm the conflict and paints a complex portrait of a border state, neither wholly North nor South.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert Tracy McKenzie</strong><em> i</em>s Associate Professor of History at Wheaton College.

Plantation Belt and Upcountry in Civil War-Era Tennessee</em>, which received awards from the American Historical Association's Pacific Coast Branch and the Agricultural History Society.<br><br>"<em>Lincolnites and Rebels</em> is based on a vast array of original source material, and it is well organized and well written. Knoxville's Civil War story is full of economic and sociopolitical twists and turns and interesting, opinioned characters. McKenzie does an outstanding job of bringing all facets of this narrative together."--Ben Wynne, <em>The North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Robert Tracy McKenzie's excellent study of wartime Knoxville reinforces that recent scholarship with exhaustive research and interpretive verve....<em>Lincolnites and Rebels</em> deserves to find an audience among all scholars of the war, not just those who look to the mountains."--Kenneth W.

From the pages of <em>Licolnites and Rebels</em> emerges a clear image of a complex issue underlying the heart of the Civil War. The division of a nation would not be, indeed could not be, accomplished with surgical precision."--Sharon A. Roger Hepburn, <em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"An unusually well written, solid, scholarly study, filled with colorful vignettes....Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Knoxville, Tennessee, in the 1860s was a deeply divided town in a deeply divided region, a place where the dictates of conscience collided repeatedly with the constraints of power. Tracy McKenzie has brilliantly illuminated the complex issues of loyalty and dissent in the Civil War South. This book is essential reading for anyone who seeks a richer understanding not only of the Civil War but also of the moral crisis faced by people of any time or place who find themselves living under enemy rule."--Stephen V. Ash, University of Tennessee<p></p><br>"An important addition to our understanding of the Civil War in the Appalachian South....It appears unlikely to this reviewer that this study will be superseded."--Gordon McKinney, <em>Civil War Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Tracy McKenzie's compelling story of neighbor against neighbor in Knoxville, Tennessee, during the Civil War goes right to the heart of questions about allegiance. In this strategic southern city--a commercial center in a major food producing region, a railroad center with connections to both the eastern and western theaters of war--the white residents were split almost 50/50 between the Union and the Confederacy. A vivid portrait of human anguish and conflict, a civil war inside a civil war."--Vernon Burton, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<p></p><br>"No other community in the Confederate South was perceived to be as much of a Unionist stronghold as was Knoxville, Tennessee. Yet it defies such easy categorization, as Tracy McKenzie demonstrates in this richly detailed portrait of an Appalachian populace that remained sharply divided throughout the Civil War and beyond. He not only provides an insightful case study of antebellum and wartime loyalties and the range of forces that shaped them; he also tells a very human story of people at war, and infuses it with an often palpable sense of drama and even suspense."--John C. Inscoe, University of Georgia<p></p><br>"This author's compelling portrait of Knoxville, Tennessee, during the Civil War is the very best sort of community study....McKenzie's nuanced monograph deserves wide attention from historians seeking to understand the meaning of loyalty in wartime and civilians' experience of the Cival War."--Alison Clark Efford, <em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"Illuminating and deeply researched...An excellent work of complexity and nuance."--<em>The Tennessee Historical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"A well-written book [that] should be read by everyone trying to understand the values held by communities and individuals that drove them to adopt a pro-Union or pro-Confederate belief and how those values changed as the war progressed."--Charles H. Bogart, <em>Post Library</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology</h2><p>This book shows, for the first time, how modern biotechnology grew out of this century&#39;s hopes for a new relationship between biology and engineering. Long before recombinant DNA, these promised a new kind of technology. By exploring the rich and surprisingly overlooked complex of prophesies, industrial and scientific development and government programs, the book sheds new light on the expectations now held for biotechnology. A world-wide view, covering developments, not just in America but also in Europe and Japan, uncovers surprising links. This makes possible a coherent story to supersede the historical notes which have been available until now. This first history of biotechnology provides a readable and challenging account that will appeal to anyone interested in the development of this key component of modern industry.</p><p>Exploring the rich and suprisingly overlooked complex of prophesies, industrial and scientific development and government programs, this book sheds new light on the expectations now held for biotechnology in a world-wide view spanning America, Europe and Japan.Good or bad? New or old? The rich connotations of the word 'biotechnology' reflect a history that stretches back more than seventy years. To some, the concept describes the evolving crafts of industrial production using micro-organisms. To others, biotechnology is a product of the recombinant techniques only recently developed by molecular biologists. It has been seen simply as a means of wealth production and as a new kind of technology--sometimes as distinctively benevolent and at all other times as particularly dangerous. <p>Robert Bud shows how the hopes and fears for the combination of biology with engineering have been an integral part of the history of the twentieth century, including the Great Depression of the 1930s, the two world wars, and the more recent anxieties over genetic and entrepreneurial industry. Skillfully, the author relates biotechnology's origins in the chemistry and microbiology of the nineteenth century. Personalities with influential roles in its subsequent development such as Chaim Weizmann, Kark Ereky, Patrick Geddes, Lewis Mumford, Joshua Lederberg, and Jeremy Rifkin, among many others, are discussed. Analysis of the changing roles and hopes for biotechnology in government and society takes the book to the end of the 1980s, when recombinant DNA techniques had become the dominant driving force behind what today we think of as biotechnology. </p><p>This first history of biotechnology provides a readable and challenging account for anyone interested in the development of this key component of modern industry.</p></p><h2>Marine Cargo Operations: A Guide to Stowage</h2><p>Marine Cargo Operations clearly spells out the basic principles of cargo operations and acquaints merchant officers with the techniques of stowage and their application.

The forests were cleared; the land was farmed intensively through the mid-nineteenth century and then was allowed to reforest naturally as agriculture shifted west. Today, in many ways the region is more natural than at any time since the American Revolution. This fascinating natural history is essential background for anyone interested in New England's ecology, wildlife, or landscape. </p><p> </p><p> In <i>New England Forests through Time</i> these historical and environmental lessons are told through the world-renowned dioramas in Harvard's Fisher Museum. These remarkable models have introduced New England's landscape to countless visitors and have appeared in many ecology, forestry, and natural history texts. This first book based on the dioramas conveys the phenomenal history of the land, the beauty of the models, and new insights into nature. </p></p><p>David R. Foster is Director of the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, and teaches ecology at Harvard University.Eighty years ago, before virtual reality, before cinematic fantasies, Richard T. Fisher, then director of the Harvard Forest, and Ernest Stillman, a philanthropist, created a state-of-the-art display to try to explain the changes that occurred in New England over time. This book is both a historical document, giving a sense of how the science of forestry some 75 years ago understood the extent of man's impact on the environment, and a scientific synopsis of our current understanding of the ecological effects of agriculture and urbanization. (<i>Chicago Botanic Garden, Current Books</i>)<br><br>In the museum at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, are 23 large dioramas showing how that land looked at various periods during the past 300 years.

John F. Murray, for many years Chief of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division of the hospital and a Professor at the University of California, San Francisco, takes readers on his daily ward rounds, introducing them to the desperately ill patients he treats as well as to the young physicians and medical students who accompany him. Writing with compassion and knowledge accumulated over a long career, Murray presents the true stories of patients who show up with myriad disorders: asthma, cardiac failure, gastrointestinal diseases, complications due to AIDS, the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, emphysema. Readers will come away from this book with a comprehensive understanding of what an ICU is, what it does, who gets admitted, and how doctors and nurses make decisions concerning life-threatening medical problems. <br><br> Intensive care for critically ill patients is a new but well-established and growing branch of medicine. Estimates suggest that 15 to 20 percent of all hospitalized patients in the United States are treated in an intensive or coronary care unit during each hospital stay, so there is a real possibility that the reader will either be admitted to an ICU himself or herself or knows someone who will be. Murray not only offers a real-time account of the diagnosis, treatment, and progress of his patients over the course of one month but also conveys a wealth of information about various diseases and medical procedures in succinct and easy-to-understand terms. In addition, he elaborates on ethical dilemmas that he confronts on an almost daily basis: the extent of patient autonomy, the denial of ICU care, the withdrawal of life support, and physician-assisted suicide. <br><br> Murray concludes that ICUs are doing their job, but they could be even better, cheaper, and--most important--more humane. His chronicle brings substance to a world known to most of us only through the fiction of television.</p><p>"This is an excellent book, full of this eminent doctor's expertise, and his never-failing compassion for his ramshackle alcoholic and drug-addicted patients. San Francisco General Hospital is famous for its care of the disadvantaged who are not wanted in private hospitals. . . . I predict that this book may well become a classic of its kind."&#x2015;Carolyn Kizer, author of <i>The Nearness of You</i><br><br>&#x201c;I started this book skeptical about reading yet another doctor's story--but once into it, I read straight through with great interest and deep appreciation. Writing lucidly, engagingly, and often eloquently, Murray uses his month's tour of duty as senior physician to the intensive care unit of an academic hospital in San Francisco as a prism. Through it he lays out a spectrum of the elements of modern medicine's art and science and shares his thoughtful insights into the ethical, economic, and human overtones of caring for sick people in today's society.&#x201d;&#x2015;Leonard Laster, author of <i>Life After Medical School</i><b>John F.

Claiming Earth: Race, Rage, Rape, Redemption: Blacks Seeking A Culture of Enlightened Empowerment outlines practical possibilities for the individual to contribute to, remain involved in, and positively impact on Black world struggle. Madhubuti insists, &#34;&#34;My aim in Claiming Earth is to articulate a politics of empowerment at an individual, community and people level that is intimately tied to education, economics, social and environmental development and human politics for the many, rather than the corrupt few....Claiming Earth is about moving from victimhood to self-reliance, to ownership of self, resources, land and, yes, our tomorrows...I am in search of healthy rituals that aid in our continued renewal&#34;&#34;.

Yet this groundbreaking book does exactly that. Drawing on an enormous body of historical evidence&#x2015;including records of the Inquisition itself&#x2015;the historian Stuart Schwartz investigates the idea of religious tolerance and its evolution in the Hispanic world from 1500 to 1820.

At the same time, parents sometimes wonder if the imaginary companion might be a sign that something is wrong. Does having a pretend friend mean that the child is in emotional distress? That he or she has difficulty communicating with other children? In this fascinating book, Marjorie Taylor provides an informed look at current thinking about pretend friends, dispelling many myths about them. <br> In the past a child with an imaginary companion might have been considered peculiar, shy, or even troubled, but according to Taylor the reality is much more positive--and interesting. Not only are imaginary companions surprisingly common, the children who have them tend to be less shy than other children. They also are better able to focus their attention and to see things from another person's perspective. In addition to describing imaginary companions and the reasons children create them, Taylor discusses other aspects of children's fantasy lives, such as their belief in Santa, their dreams, and their uncertainty about the reality of TV characters. Adults who remember their own childhood pretend friends will be interested in the chapter on the relationship between imaginary companions in childhood and adult forms of fantasy. Taylor also addresses practical concerns, providing many useful suggestions for parents. For example, she describes how children often express their own feelings by attributing them to their imaginary companion. <br> If you have a child who creates imaginary creatures, or if you work with pre-schoolers, you will find this book very helpful in understanding the roles that imaginary companions play in children's emotional lives.</p><p><br><strong>Marjorie Taylor</strong> is Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon.

At the same time, for the disinterested reader, she describes many vivid<br>specimens of the phenomenon and engages in enough conceptual analysis to show that this intriguing aspect of children's early fantasy raises fundamental questions about human imagination."

Setting aside traditional models charting a linear progress from persecution to toleration, it emphasises instead the complex interplay between these two impulses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The book examines the intellectual assumptions that underpinned attitudes towards religious minorities and the institutional structures and legal mechanisms by which they were both repressed and accommodated. It also explores the social realities of prejudice and forbearance, hostility and harmony at the level of the neighbourhood and parish. Simultaneously, it surveys the range of ways in which dissenting churches and groups responded and adapted to official and popular intolerance, investigating how the experience of suffering helped to forge sectarian identities. In analysing the consequences of the advancing pluralism of English society in the wake of the Reformation, this study illuminates the cultural processes that shaped and complicated the conditions of coexistence before and after the Act of Toleration of 1689.</p><p>Alexandra Walsham is Professor of Reformation History at the University of Exeter&#x201c;Alexandra Walsham, with all her fresh insights and suggestions, never fails to be judicious.

He relates combat and conversation in the immediate vernacular taking care to cite the name, rank and home of each marine.</p><p>In the summer and fall of 1942, American Marines landed on the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal and began the slow, bloody work of defeating the Japanese empire. Their landing was significant not only for the outcome of World War II, but also for the conduct of war ever since, for the invasion of Guadalcanal marked the first time that a combined air, sea, and land assault had ever been attempted. It is for that reason that tacticians and military historians study the months-long battle today, and their primary guide to that conflict is Richard Tregaskis's extraordinary <i>Guadalcanal Diary</i>.<p> A volunteer combat correspondent, Tregaskis braved much danger to bring the story of the fighting to American readers. But he was not one to celebrate his own exploits, and in the pages of his book, he centers on the brave young men from all over the United States who fought and died in appalling numbers. His attention to detail yields arresting descriptions of attacks and counterattacks, of moments of low morale and of exaltation, of moments of quiet behind the lines and of sheer terror at the very point of engagement. Tregaskis's style is unadorned and matter-of-fact, and his present-tense narrative places the reader in the thick of the battle during those "hopeless weeks."</p><p> The direct literary ancestor of books of military reportage such as Mark Bowden's <i>Black Hawk Down</i> and Michael Herr's <i>Dispatches</i>, <i>Guadalcanal Diary</i> is an exemplary work of journalism, and as vivid a portrait of men under fire as has ever been committed to print. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>history&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S.A. $14.95<br>Canada $22.50<br>This celebrated classic gives a soldier's-eye-view of the Guadalcanal battles--crucial to World War II, the war that continues to fascinate us all, and to military history in general. Unlike some of those on Guadalcanal in the fall of 1942, Richard Tregaskis volunteered to be there. An on-location news correspondent (at the time, one of only two on Guadalcanal), he lived alongside the soldiers: sleeping on the ground--only to be awoken by air raids--eating the sometimes meager rations, and braving some of the most dangerous battlefields of World War II. He more than once narrowly escaped the enemy's fire, and so we have this incisive and exciting inside account of the groundbreaking initial landing of U.S. troops on Guadalcanal. <br><br>With a new Introduction by Mark Bowden--renowned journalist and author of Black Hawk Down--this edition of Guadalcanal Diary makes available once more one of the most important American works of the war.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Dark Souls: Beyond the Grave Volume 1: Demon&#x2019;s Souls &#x2013; Dark Souls &#x2013; Dark Souls II</h2><p>If the Dark Souls series managed to seduce players and journalists, it was mainly by word of mouth.

The standard answer has been that small genetic mutations accumulate over time to produce wondrous innovations such as eyes and wings. Drawing on cutting-edge research across the spectrum of modern biology, Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart demonstrate how this stock answer is woefully inadequate. Rather they offer an original solution to the longstanding puzzle of how small random genetic change can be converted into complex, useful innovations.<br><br>In a new theory they call facilitated variation,&#x201d; Kirschner and Gerhart elevate the individual organism from a passive target of natural selection to a central player in the 3-billion-year history of evolution. In clear, accessible language, the authors invite every reader to contemplate daring new ideas about evolution. By closing the major gap in Darwin&#x2019;s theory Kirschner and Gerhart also provide a timely scientific rebuttal to modern critics of evolution who champion intelligent design.&#x201d;<p></p></p><p><b>Marc W.

They posit that these fields are the general building blocks of political and economic life, civil society, and the state, and the fundamental form of order in our world today. Similar to Russian dolls, they are nested and connected in a broader environment of almost countless proximate and overlapping fields. Fields are mutually dependent; change in one often triggers change in another. At the core of the theory is an account of how social actors fashion and maintain order in a given field. This sociological theory of action, what they call "social skill," helps explain what individuals do in strategic action fields to gain cooperation or engage in competition. <br><br>To demonstrate the breadth of the theory, Fligstein and McAdam make its abstract principles concrete through extended case studies of the Civil Rights Movement and the rise and fall of the market for mortgages in the U.S. since the 1960s. The book also provides a "how-to" guide to help others implement the approach and discusses methodological issues.<br><br>With a bold new approach, <em>A Theory of Fields </em>offers both a rigorous and practically applicable way of thinking through and making sense of social order and change-and how one emerges from the other-in modern, complex societies.<br></p><p><br><strong>Neil Fligstein</strong> is the Class of 1939 Chancellor's Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley.

Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized. Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore: <blockquote> Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest. </blockquote> From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of "'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'" <p> In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing "commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion." His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his "love of the game for its own sake," makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raises <i>Kim</i> above the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kim is an orphan, living from hand to mouth in the teeming streets of Lahore. One day he meets a man quite unlike anything in his wide experience, a Tibetan lama on a quest. Kim's life suddenly acquires meaning and purpose as he becomes the lama's guide and protector--his chela. Other forces are at work as Kim is sucked into the intrigue of the Great Game and travels the Grand Trunk Road with his lama.<p></p><p>How Kim and the lama meet their respective destinies on the road and in the mountains of India forms one of the most compelling adventure tales of all time.</p></p><h2>The Renaissance in Europe</h2><p>This new, compact, up-to-date text presents a comprehensive view of the Renaissance, stressing its roots in Italy--a region that never lost contact with its Roman past.

What does flamenco dance tell us about the construction of race in the Atlantic world? <em>Sonidos Negros</em> traces how, in the span between 1492 and 1933, the vanquished Moor became Black, and how this figure, enacted in terms of a minstrelized <em>Gitano</em>, paradoxically came to represent Spain itself. <br><br>The imagined Gypsy about which flamenco imagery turns dances on a knife's edge delineating Christian and non-Christian, White and Black worlds. This figure's subversive teetering undermines Spain's symbolic linkage of religion with race, a prime weapon of conquest. Flamenco's <em>Sonidos Negros</em> live in this precarious balance, amid the purposeful confusion and ruckus cloaking embodied resistance, the lament for what has been lost, and the values and aspirations of those rendered imperceptible by enslavement and colonization.<br></p><p><br>K.

It does this from historical, anthropological, and sociological angles which until now have scarcely been tread. It is another way of viewing and interpreting history, which constructs unprecedented identities -- it identifies "Blackness" with "religious confusion" -- and unusual binaries -- blood purity/depravity, purity/impurity. It constitutes a complete challenge to traditionally assumed concepts." -- Jos� Luis Navarro Garcia, author of <em>Semillas de �bano: el elemento negro y</em> <em>afroamericano en el baile flamenco</em><p></p><br>"Accessibly written and engaging, K. Meira Goldberg has gifted us an original monograph that will impress and tantalize a diverse array of readers across many scholarly disciplines in the humanities and social sciences." -- <em>Black Perspectives</em><p></p><br>"<em>Sonidos Negros</em> is a majestic work - readable, revelatory, and bringing to bear all Goldberg's previous work in research and practice to reach this tome of truth. She speaks in a voice both personal and professional, inviting us in to share the insights of a life lived in flamenco, insights that may well shake up the ways in which scholars and lay readers, alike, perceive what it means to look at what we think we know, or realize we don't know, with new eyes." -- From the Foreword by Brenda Dixon Gottschild<p></p><br>A surprising and necessary book, especially in an area - flamenco studies - where there is little scholarship bringing together ample documentation, interpretive richness and, above all, an original focus.

This involves going through spatial biochemical, electrophysiological, and organismic dynamical systems and patterns that were discovered by pursuing the theme of phase singularities introduced in the original book. In particular the work on excitability in cell membranes will be thoroughly updated as will the references throughout the book.</p><p><p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"This book is a wonderful exposition about his life&#x2019;s work and is presented with such clarity that the reader gains an insight into details of his manner of thinking...the reader is taken on a quest to solve biological mysteries and travels from the intricate beginnings of formulating the questions, through the apices and troughs of analyzing, and on to the discovery of the holy grail, that which yields biological predictions and answers. One leaves with a sense of understanding that hopefully can be applied to one&#x2019;s own work...this book could easily serve a dual purpose. First, through the introduction of basic mathematical concepts such as topology combined with modeling, the book serves as an introduction helping the non-applied reader to see the beauty of mathematical modeling. Second, because Winfree explains the modeling process very thoroughly, instead of just presenting equations, the book can serve as a medium for the medical professional to acquire an understanding of the modeling process. A wonderful accomplishment...I am proud to have this book on my shelf and consider it...a seminal text in mathematical modeling. This is a text that every first year graduate student should look at in some detail." <em>(Mathematical Reviews)</em></p> <p>"The new edition of The Geometry of Biological Time is a fascinating update of the delightful original. This new edition contains thoughtful commentary on new developments in the field, adding a historical and sociological dimension to the original book's elegant and unifying treatment of biological problems involving processes that repeat themselves regularly, i.e. involve 'rhythmic return through a cycle of change.' The book is an enjoyable page-turner, even for those readers with only a passing interest in biology, and demonstrates well the synergistic effect between biology and mathematics. ...<br>The term 'page-turner' may seem unusual in mathematics; however, it is appropriate here. Not only is the reader continually tantalized by the figures appearing on the ensuing pages, but the new commentary lends a mystery-novel feeling to the book. This second edition was created by inserting new text boxes into the original, mostly intact, edition. This style leads to a fascinating historical picture. For example, the text, '(...In the latter cases the periodicity approximation gets worse closer to the pivot. I wish here to sweep such matters under the rug (in 1978))' is followed by a new text box that begins, 'The bulge under the rug grew and grew...', continuing with a description of developments over the last two decades. The plot continues even now, with descriptions of the last twenty years often followed in the book by descriptions of current puzzles. In summary, the original book is good and the second edition is even better; the historical commentary is fascinating, and there are also a few reorganized and new chapters presenting additonal biological examples." <em>(MAA Online)</em></p></p><h2>Collector's Reference &amp; Value Guide to the Lone Ranger</h2><p>Who was that masked man?

Widely used in college courses on Chicano and Southwestern history and culture, the volume provides a comprehensive general history of the Mexican experience in the United States, beginning with the early aboriginal inhabitants. Now fully updated by Matt S. Meier to cover the period 1945 through 1988, <i>North From Mexico</i> explores all aspects of the Chicano experience in the United States including family, employment, education, assimilation, political, cultural, and economic issues. Particularly valuable is the inclusion of current statistical and census data on immigration patterns, educational and voting characteristics, and social and economic trends in the Hispanic population.</p><p></p><p>Material new to this edition includes an overview of the development of Mexican-American organizations and leaders and the struggle for greater acceptance in American society that has characterized the Mexican-American experience in recent decades. Particular attention is focused on the movimiento, the movement for civil and political equality with other Americans. Meier stresses the cultural aspects of the movement and profiles key leaders. Among the other issues central to the Mexican-American experience since 1945 which receive detailed coverage are the immigration and naturalization of Mexicans, the social and economic role of undocumented workers from Mexico, and the effects of the Simpson-Rodino Immigration Reform and Control Act. Meier also contrasts the considerable achievements of Mexican-Americans in the political and cultural spheres with the persistently high rates of unemployment and poverty that continue to plague the Hispanic population.

Having recognized that any state within cyclic existence involves suffering,the practitioner develops a strong wish for freedom. But to cut the root of cyclic existence it is necessary to know how things exists at the most fundamental level. Even if one has turned away from the causes of suffering and gained an undistorted understanding of reality, supreme enlightenment will remain out of reach without the altruistic intention to act selflessly for the good and happiness of all living beings. In this teaching, Geshe Sonam Rinchen explains in clear and readily accessible terms Je Tsongkhapa&#39;s (1357-1419) short text on these three principal aspects of the path. This engaging exposition of the essential steps to enlightenment will be appreciated both by those with no previous exposure to Buddhism and by these who wish to undertake the practices of tantra, for which at least a sound understanding of these three is essential.</p><p>The wish for freedom, altruistic intention, and the wisdom of emptiness constitute the three principal aspects of the path to enlightenment. The essential prerequisite is a strong wish for freedom. But to know how to attain freedom and cut the root of cyclic existence, it is necessary to have the correct understanding of reality. Even with a feeling of antipathy to this cycle of involuntary birth and death and an undistorted understanding of reality, supreme enlightenment will remain out of reach without the altruistic intention to act selflessly for the good and happiness of all living beings. These three are the key --everything that the Buddha thought necessary to attain enlightenment is contained in these teachings. <p>"Geshe Rinchen splendidly elucidates and expands on the short dialogue of Je Tsongkhapa."--John Tigue, Ph.D., for Explorations</p>Geshe Sonam Rinchen was born in Tibet in 1933.

Abstract patterns in wallpaper or carpet suggest households that have been lovingly attended to, but Weischer invests this decor with an oddly noisy insistence, so that its sheer &#34;effect&#34; invades any space a human presence might occupy. Often an entire ceiling or a part of a wall is omitted, so that Weischer&#39;s homes quickly come to seem absurdly staged, like sets that are wholly indifferent to habitation. Subtle perspectival collisions and a frequently clinical treatment of light compound these atmospheres of banal anxiety, and Weischer&#39;s impasto paint application further intensifies the claustrophobic pressure--even while imparting his evident enjoyment in detailing ornamental effect. The artist&#39;s conceptual preoccupations are consistent, but the emotional nuances of his paintings vary greatly. With over 200 color plates, this is an impressive catalogue raisonne for one of the Leipzig School&#39;s most promising stars.</p><p></p><h2>Inuit Art</h2><p>"What we show in our carvings is the life we have lived in the past right up to today.

Engaging and authoritative, Inuit Art: An Introduction explores Inuit art from historical, cultural and aesthetic perspectives. The engrossing story begins with an outline of the roots of Inuit art in prehistoric times and through the historical period that began with the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century. The emergence of Inuit art as we know it came about in the late 1940s, partly through the encouragement of writer and artist James Houston, who also introduced printmaking to Inuit artists. Inspired by his support, Inuit artists quickly brought their art to life, attracting a wide audience almost overnight, and they have continued to develop and refine their work over the past fifty years. To enrich our understanding of the art, Ingo Hessel also provides descriptions of techniques and materials.</p><p><b>Ingo Hessel</b> is the Albrecht Adjunct Curator of Inuit Art at the Heard Museum in Phoenix.

Instead of striving to perfect any particular literary form, Twain strove to precisely imprint on paper the colloquial speech, mannerisms and experiences of the American people.</p><p>Twain's books earned him an enduring reputation as a satirist and humorist, but he also wrote great short stories. These stories, with their wonderful characters and witty turns-of-phrase, have defined in Americans' minds what it means to have been at a time in our country which was at once optimistic, exploratory and recklessly exploitative.</p><p>Listeners can still benefit today from hearing Mark Twain's stories and selections from his novels as they become again what they originally were: the oral history of our uniquely American consciousness.</p><p>Includes selections from <em>Life on the Mississippi, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Roughing It, and The Autobiography of Mark Twain, </em> and the short stories <em> The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, The �1,000,000 Bank-Note, The Joke That Made Ed's Fortune, A Dog's Tale, A Story Without an End</em> and many more.</p><p>Performed by Ed Begley, Sr., Walter Brennan, Brandon de Wilde, Will Geer, and David Wayne</p></p><p><p>Mark Twain, who was born Samuel L. Clemens in Missouri in 1835, wrote some of the most enduring works of literature in the English language, including <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> and <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>. <em>Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc</em> was his last completed book&#x2014;and, by his own estimate, his best. Its acquisition by Harper &amp; Brothers allowed Twain to stave off bankruptcy. He died in 1910.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Ed Begley, Sr. was a prolific radio actor and from 1944-1948 he played the title role in the radio version of <em>Charlie Chan</em>. In 1947, Begley created the role of benighted war profiteer Joe Keller in Arthur Miller's <em>All My Sons</em>. He was a familiar figure in TV's "golden age" of the 1950s, and appeared 789 times as the William Jennings Bryan counterpart in the Broadway drama <em>Inherit the Wind</em>.</p>This rich archive of Twain stories and excerpts is drawn from Caedmon recordings made in the '50s and '60s. Five actors provide the voices of Twain. Ed Begley, Sr., and Will Geer read excerpts from Twain's LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI, and Geer continues with many of the other selections from THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARK TWAIN in his clear, jocular tones. Walter Brennan's performance of THE NOTORIOUS JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY stands out--the listener can envision the country store and an old raconteur spinning tales. David Wayne is perhaps the only disappointment; his unaccented speech seems too dry and crisp. Careful remastering has cleaned up the sound and produced a program free of distracting flaws.

He has published numerous literary works in translation, as well as several nonfiction books, including a previous memoir <i>Genji Days</i> that focuses on the translation of <i>Tale of Genji.</i> He divides his time between Tokyo and Honolulu.In 1942 at the age of 21, having graduated from college and at a loss as to what to do with himself, Seidensticker (emeritus, Columbia Univ.) decided to attend the Navy Japanese Language School. He went on to become one of the first and best-known translators of Japanese literature into English and the recipient of a National Book Award, as well as the Order of the Rising Sun, Japan's highest honor for foreigners. His memoir offers insights into Japan's intellectual and cultural life from World War II through the 1970s. His immersion in the Japanese language allowed him to serve as a diplomat during the Occupation. He translated, most notably, the 11th-century Tale of Genji, as well as works by Junichiro Tanzani, Yukio Mishima, and Nobel prize winner Yasunari Kawabata. Here he discusses the translator's challenge in approaching Eastern literature from a Western viewpoint. The author's meeting with Japanese writers and his comments regarding how best to approach English-speaking audiences offers an insider's view to contemporary Japanese culture and mores.

Adorno (1903-1969), one of the principal figures associated with the Frankfurt School, wrote extensively on culture, modernity, aesthetics, literature, and&#x2015;more than any other subject&#x2015;music. To this day, Adorno remains the single most influential contributor to the development of qualitative musical sociology which, together with his nuanced intertextual readings of musical works, gives him broad claim as a continuing force in the study of music. This long-awaited collection of twenty-seven essays represents the full range of Adorno's music writing. Nearly half of the essays appear in English for the first time; all of the essays are fully annotated; and the previously translated essays have been corrected and missing text restored, making this volume the definitive resource on Adorno's musical thought.</p><p>"A book of landmark importance. It is unprecedented in its design: a brilliantly selected group of essays on music coupled with lucid, deeply incisive, and in every way masterly analysis of Adorno's thinking about music. No one who studies Adorno and music will be able to dispense with it; and if they can afford only one book on Adorno and music, this will be the one. For in miniature, it contains everything one needs: a collection of exceptionally important writings on all the principal aspects of music and musical life with which Adorno dealt; totally reliable scholarship; and powerfully illuminating commentary that will help readers at all levels read and re-read the essays in question."&#x2015;Rose Rosengard Subotnik, author of <i>Deconstructive Variations: Music and Reason in Western Society</i> <br><br>"An invaluable contribution to Adorno scholarship, with well chosen essays on composers, works, the culture industry, popular music, kitsch, and technology. Leppert's introduction and commentaries are consistently useful; his attention to secondary literature remarkable; his interpretation responsible. The new translations by Susan Gillespie (and others) are outstanding not only for their care and readability, but also for their sensitivity to Adorno's forms and styles."&#x2015;Lydia Goehr, author of <i>The Quest for Voice: Music, Politics and the Limits of Philosophy</i> <br><br>"With its careful, full edition of Adorno's important musical texts and its exhaustive yet eminently readable commentaries, Richard Leppert's magisterial book represents a brilliant solution to the age-old dilemma of bringing together primary text and interpretation in one volume."&#x2015;James Deaville, Director, School of the Arts, McMaster University<br><br>"The developing variations of Adorno's life-long involvement with musical themes are fully audible in this remarkable collection. What might be called his 'literature on notes' brilliantly complements the 'notes to literature' he devoted to the written word. Richard Leppert's superb commentaries constitute a book-length contribution in their own right, which will enlighten and challenge even the most learned of Adorno scholars."&#x2015;Martin Jay, author of <i>The Dialectical Imagination: A History of The Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research</i> <br><br>"There is afoot in Anglo-American musicology today the first wholesale reconsideration of Adorno's thought since the pioneering work of Rose Rosengard Subotnik around 1980. <i>Essays on Music</i> will play a central role in this effort. It will do so because Richard Leppert has culled Adorno's writings so as to make clear to musicologists the place of music in the broad critique of modernity that was Adorno's overarching project; and it will do so because Leppert has explained these writings, in commentaries that amount to a book-length study, so as to reveal to non-musicologists the essentially musical foundation of this project. No one interested in Adorno from any perspective&#x2015;or, for that matter, in modernity and music all told&#x2015;can afford to ignore <i>Essays on Music.</i>"&#x2015;Gary Tomlinson, author of <i>Metaphysical Song: An Essay on Opera</i> <br><br>"This book is both a major achievement by its author-editor and a remarkable act of scholarly generosity for the rest of us. Until now, English translations of Adorno's major essays on music have been scattered and often unreliable. Until now, there has been no comprehensive scholarly treatment of Adorno's musical thinking. This volume remedies both problems at a single stroke. It will be read equally&#x2015;and eagerly&#x2015;for Adorno's texts and for Richard Leppert's commentary on them, both of which will continue to be essential resources as musical scholarship seeks increasingly to come to grips with the social contexts and effects of music. No one knows Adorno better than Leppert, and no one is better equipped to clarify the complex interweaving of sociology, philosophy, and musical aesthetics that is central to Adorno's work. From now on, everyone who reads Adorno on music, whether a beginner or an expert, is in Richard Leppert's debt for devoting his exceptional gifts of learning and lucidity to this project."&#x2015;Lawrence Kramer, author of <i>Musical Meaning: Toward a Critical History</i><b>Richard Leppert</b> is Samuel Russell Distinguished Professor of Humanities and Morse Alumni Distinguished Teaching Professor in the Department of Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature at the University of Minnesota.

The experiences of &#x201c;fancy&#x201d; publishers, &#x201c;flash&#x201d; editors, and &#x201c;racy&#x201d; novelists, who all managed to pursue their trade in the face of laws criminalizing obscene publications, dramatically convey nineteenth-century America&#x2019;s daring notions of sex, gender, and desire, as well as the frequently counterproductive results of attempts to enforce conventional moral standards. </p><p>In nineteenth-century New York, the business of erotic publishing and legal attacks on obscenity developed in tandem, with each activity shaping and even promoting the pursuit of the other. Obscenity prohibitions, rather than curbing salacious publications, inspired innovative new styles of forbidden literature&#x2015;such as works highlighting expressions of passion and pleasure by middle-class American women. Obscenity prosecutions also spurred purveyors of lewd materials to devise novel schemes to evade local censorship by advertising and distributing their products through the mail. This subterfuge in turn triggered far-reaching transformations in strategies for policing obscenity. </p><p>Donna Dennis offers a colorful, groundbreaking account of the birth of an indecent print trade and the origins of obscenity regulation in the United States. By revealing the paradoxes that characterized early efforts to suppress sexual expression in the name of morality, she suggests relevant lessons for our own day.</p></p><p>Donna Dennis is Professor of Law and Justice Frederick W. Hall Scholar at Rutgers Law School, Newark.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda In the 19th century, a bookseller who stocked John Cleland's "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" -- a novel better known as "Fanny Hill" -- could be arrested, severely fined and sentenced to prison. In my own youth, "Fanny Hill" was still kept behind the counter at Rusine's cigar store, carefully sealed in plastic shrink-wrap. Today it's a Penguin Classic and frequently taught in college literature courses. The world changes. In "Licentious Gotham," Donna Dennis, a professor at Rutgers School of Law in Newark, carefully examines a series of prosecutions and legal battles to better understand the extent and character of erotic publishing in 19th-century America. She also aims to reconstruct "the meaning of obscenity" during that time and repeatedly shows how prohibitions "promoted, as much as suppressed, the proliferation of sexual representations." Dennis begins by discussing such antebellum "flash" weeklies as the Whip, the Libertine of New York, the Weekly Rake and the long-running National Police Gazette. These papers offered sporting men news about Manhattan low life and specialized "in lavish descriptions of the milieu of New York prostitution, for which they provided a veritable directory to the best and worst prostitutes, brothels, and madams in the city." The Sunday Flash even ran an 18-part series called "Lives of the Nymphs." "Each number featured a lengthy biographical sketch of a prominent New York prostitute." As Dennis makes clear, this "flash" press made most of its money out of extortion: The editors "humiliated private figures and attempted to blackmail prominent citizens. They also violated public order and offended Christian sensibilities by brazenly marketing their papers in public spaces and on Sundays. And by openly discussing prostitution and extramarital sex, they shone an unwanted, embarrassing light on licentiousness in Gotham." But these weeklies were eventually overshadowed by the lucrative trade in "fancy" books, "elegant" engravings and "racy" yellow-back pamphlets. (All three of those adjectives were code for what we would now call "hard-core.") Many of these "standard works of the voluptuary" were imported from England or supposedly translated from scandalous French originals. Whatever their naughty contents, the language of their titles is certainly luscious: Consider "The Confessions of a Voluptuous Lady of High Rank. Disclosing Her Secret Longings and Private Amours before Marriage. Forming a Curious Picture of Fashionable Life and Refined Sensuality" or "The Cabinet of Venus Unlocked in a Series of Dialogues between Louisa Lovestone and Mariana Greedy, Two Cyprians! of the Most Accomplished Talent in the Science of Practical Love." If memory serves, a few of the books mentioned by Dennis, or at least their titles, could still be found in my youth: "The Lustful Turk," for instance, and "The Curtain Drawn Up; or, The Education of Laura." Dennis points out that many of these works boldly highlight the existence of female sexuality: Women were actually depicted experiencing desire, even lust. This, she suggests, was a kind of progress, given an era when wives were generally expected to show no signs of passion and were usually advised -- in the old British phrase -- to simply lie back and think of England. But the world really was changing. In 1856, George Akarman inaugurated the country's first sex magazine, Venus' Miscellany. It was sold by mail and thus discreetly available to anyone anywhere. Before long, the magazine's popular letters column was encouraging ordinary women, as well as men, to describe their sex lives and fantasies. No doubt much of this material was made up by the editors. And yet the very existence of such a feature suggests that eroticism could move out of the brothel or the French chateau and actually become middle-class and downright American. In the pages of Venus' Miscellany, pornographers advertised their "fancy" books, and some of the more entrepreneurial branched out to offer condoms, sex toys, alleged aphrodisiacs and even abortion aids. In fact, anything gynecological could be marketed as erotic, including a dour and wonderfully titled polemic against female masturbation: "The Secret Habits of the Female Sex: Letters Addressed to a Mother on the Evils of Solitude, and its Seductive Temptations to Young Girls, the Premature Victims of a Pernicious Passion, with All Its Frightful Consequences: Deformity of Mind and Body, Destruction of Beauty, and Entailing Disease and Death; but from Which by Attention to the Timely Warnings Here Given, the Devotee May Be Saved, and Become an Ornament to Society, a Virtuous Wife, and a Refulgent Mother!" In "Licentious Gotham" Dennis also briefly outlines the career of George Thompson, the most prolific writer of what has been called "American porno-gothic," a subgenre emphasizing graphic violence, dark secrets and sexual excess, including teasing hints of incest, miscegenation, orgies and public sex. Some of Thompson's novels include "The Ladies' Garter" (c. 1851), "The Gay Girls of New York" (1854) and "The Bridal Chamber, and Its Mysteries" (1856). While Thompson freely reveled in every form of splatter-flick violence -- including disfigurement by acid and cannibalism -- he would typically build up tremendous erotic tension, then suddenly announce that the law or morality compelled him to draw a veil or "drop the curtain" over what was to ensue between some snowy-globed damsel and her well set-up admirer. Much of this "pleasurist" writing is now lost to us, known only from police accounts or the bibliographical records of the famous collector of erotica H.S. Ashbee. Thousands of books, prints and printing plates were destroyed during the long career of Anthony Comstock, who from 1873 to 1915 was secretary and chief special agent of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. (The 1873 law against sending obscene material through the mail bears his name: the Comstock Act.) In "Traps for the Young" (1883) this relentless scourge of smut actually calculated that there existed, by title, exactly 165 "bad books" when he began his more than 40-year crusade in 1872. He tried to destroy every last copy. For instance, of the Cupid's Own Library imprint a single item survives (owned appropriately by the Kinsey Institute): "The Love Feast; or, A Bride's Experience: A Poem in Six Nights." While much of "Licentious Gotham" is undeniably entertaining, much is also dryly legalistic, paying minute attention to the judicial maneuverings of both prosecutors and publishers. In short, Donna Dennis has certainly written an important work of American cultural and legal history, yet somehow it's not half as titillating as one might expect -- or hope. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Rightly or wrongly, the book has widely been seen as a blueprint for how Republicans, using the so-called Southern Strategy, could build a durable winning coalition in presidential elections. Certainly, Nixon's election marked the end of a "New Deal Democratic hegemony" and the beginning of a conservative realignment encompassing historically Democratic voters from the South and the Florida-to-California "Sun Belt," in the book&#x2019;s enduring coinage.

This genuinely interdisciplinary collection includes important new essays that draw on the work of Georges Bataille, Judith Butler, Julia Kristeva and other key critical thinkers to provide innovative readings of works of art, film, theatre and literature. The clear and accessible essays in this volume extend the existing literature on abjection in exciting new ways to demonstrate the enduring richness of the concept.</p><p>Rina Arya is Reader in Visual Communication at the University of Wolverhampton<br><br>Nicholas Chare is Associate Professor of Art History in the Department of History of Art and Film Studies at the Universit� de Montr�alThe exploration of the implications of abjection: being abject, positioning as abject, for the visual and performing arts defines for this collection a double relevance. It adds to the study of abjection; it adds also to the analysis of a range of artistic practices.... most of the chapters will themselves become significant in their areas while the whole performs an enlivening re-engagement and expansion of abjection as a term in contemporary cultural analysis.&#39; Griselda Pollock</p><h2>Building a Medical Vocabulary: with Spanish Translations (Leonard, Building a Medical Vocabulary)</h2><p><p>The language of medicine may be complex, but learning it doesn&#x2019;t have to be.

Peter Hunter Blair&#39;s book has achieved classic status, and is published now with a new, up-to-date bibliography prepared by Simon Keynes. Between the end of the Roman occupation and the coming of the Normans, England was settled by Germanic races; the kingdom as a political unit was created, heathenism yielded to a vigorous Christian Church, superb works of art were made, and the English language - spoken and written - took its form. These origins of the English heritage are Hunter Blair&#39;s subject. The first two chapters survey Anglo-Saxon England: its wars, its invaders, its peoples and its kings. The remaining chapters deal with specific aspects of its culture: its Church, government, economy and literary achievement. Throughout the author uses illustrations and a wide range of sources - documents, archaeological evidence and place names - to illuminate the period as a whole.</p><p>This third edition of Peter Hunter Blair&#39;s classic account of Anglo-Saxon history includes a wholly new introduction written by Simon Keynes.

Persuasion, the last completed novel Jane Austen wrote, was finished in 1816, the year before her death, and published posthumously in 1817. It features a heroine, Anne Elliot, older and wiser than her predecessors in earlier books, and its tone is more intimate and sober as Jane Austen unfolds a simple love-story with depth and subtlety.One of England s most beloved authors, Jane Austen wrote such classic novels as Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and Northanger Abbey. Published anonymously during her life, Austen s work was renowned for its realism, humour, and commentary on English social rites and society at the time. Austen s writing was supported by her family, particularly by her brother, Henry, and sister, Cassandra, who is believed to have destroyed, at Austen s request, her personal correspondence after Austen s death in 1817. Austen s authorship was revealed by her nephew in A Memoir of Jane Austen, published in 1869, and the literary value of her work has since been recognized by scholars around the world.</p><h2>A Guide for Using Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day in the Classroom</h2><p>This resource is directly related to its literature equivalent and filled with a variety of cross-curricular lessons to do before, during, and after reading the book.

It isn&#x2019;t about someone being out of touch, about a place that is hard to get to, or about a weekend spent offline. Off-grid is the property of a building (generally a home but sometimes even a whole town) that is disconnected from the electricity and the natural gas grid. To live off-grid, therefore, means having to radically re-invent domestic life as we know it, and this is what this book is about: individuals and families who have chosen to live in that dramatically innovative, but also quite old, way of life. </p> <p>This ethnography explores the day-to-day lives of people in each of Canada&#x2019;s provinces and territories living off the grid. Vannini and Taggart demonstrate how a variety of people, all with different environmental constraints, live away from contemporary civilization. The authors also raise important questions about our social future and whether off-grid living creates an environmentally and culturally sustainable lifestyle practice. These homes are experimental labs for our collective future, an intimate look into unusual contemporary domestic lives, and a call to the rest of us leading ordinary lives to examine what we take for granted. This book is ideal for courses on the environment and sustainability as well as introduction to sociology and introduction to cultural anthropology courses. </p></p><p><p><strong>Phillip Vannini</strong> is Canada Research Chair in Public Ethnography and Professor in the School of Communication &amp; Culture at Royal Roads University in Victoria, BC, Canada..

Many have spoken of the possibilities of utilizing more media in ethnographic work. Vannini and Taggart make this real, using photographs, video and sound recording as well as writing clearly and movingly about their subject matter in this book and related website. Through the engaging writing and the interwoven sound and visual media we are invited to explore the fascinating worlds of those who chose to live off of the grids of electricity and gas. In doing so we get a glimpse of life beyond other forms of power too, in ways which are richly suggestive of the ways we might all inhabit future worlds. <i>Off the Grid </i>is destined to stand as an exemplar of sensitive, creative ethnographic research for students, practitioners and the public at large."</strong> &#x2013; <em>Tim Cresswell, International Affairs, Northeastern University</em></p> <p><strong>"In this theoretically sophisticated yet highly accessible book, Vannini and Taggart have provided us with an exciting, handsomely detailed account of those intrepid off-gridders who have set up home in the sparsely populated, isolated vastness of Canada. In dispelling any stereotypical notions that these folk are socially awkward refugees from civilisation or romantic eco-obsessives, the lives and conversations featured here - and richly augmented by evocative and informative hyperlinks - reveal that they are inspired by diverse motivations, beliefs and enthusiasms. Yet they are united by an extraordinary resourcefulness, an ability to make do in circumstances that would force most of us to flee back to a connected world. These off-gridders may be pioneers of a future in which energy supplies have diminished but at the very least, their ingenuity may help us to consider how we may live in a more balanced relationship with the earth."</strong> &#x2013; <em>Tim Edensor, School of Science and the Environment, Manchester Metropolitan University</em></p> <p><strong>"In<em> Off the Grid</em> Phillip Vannini and Jonathan Taggart describe how people, living in relatively remote Canadian locales, are able to live beyond the pale of contemporary civilization. Using sensuous description and crafting compelling narratives, these gifted storytellers demonstrate how a life beyond the constraints of "provided" energy can challenge our assumptions about social life in modern society. Indeed, Vannini and Taggart's ethnographic portraits of "off-the-grid" people provide an inspiring example of how we might confront the serious environmental challenges that irrevocable climate change promises to produce in the future. <em>Off the Grid</em> challenges us to confront our future with a spirit of innovation and invention. As such, this highly original work has the makings of a classic ethnography that will read, savored and debated for many years to come."</strong> &#x2013; <em>Paul Stoller, anthropology, West Chester University, author of</em> Yaya's Story: The Search for Well-Being in the World<em>, and 2013</em> Anders Retzius Gold Medal Laureate in Anthology</p> <p><strong>"Through artful prose...

Their story is classic Americana, in both success and failure: two clean-cut kids from the suburbs who just love to make music together hit it big, and when Richard develops a pill addiction and Karen hits a low of 78 pounds, Coleman lays the blame on their overbearing and undemonstrative parents. To this day their mother insists that there was no psychological reason behind her daughter's starvation, believing instead that ``Karen was simply gripped by an iron determination to get very thin and stay that way.'' Coleman also traces Karen's problems back to early negative media comments about their ``square'' appearance amid the wild atmosphere in the music industry of the late-60's. While he keeps insisting that the group was never bland, Coleman's anecdotes reinforce the plain-toast image: their reproducing, note for note, the arrangements from their records when performing live; changing lyrics--e.g., ``sleep with you'' became ``be with you''--so as not to sully Karen's good- girl image; and proudly appearing at the Nixon White House in 1972. It is true that at the time of Karen's death relatively little was known about anorexia nervosa, but the eating disorder has since become familiar, and Coleman's glancing treatment of it reveals little that is new. A dual-celebrity bio that retells well-worn stories. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Despite a clean-cut image that put them distinctly at odds with the glam-rock and disco styles of other '70's bands, the Carpenters, renowned for such mellifluous hits as "Close to You" and "We've Only Just Begun," were one of the most successful pop acts of the time. But like many of their more flamboyant colleagues, they had problems: Richard Carpenter suffered through a bout of severe chemical dependency (from which he eventually recovered) while his sister Karen battled anorexia nervosa, resulting in her death in 1983. Although rock journalist Ray Coleman's ( Lennon ) authorized biography is ostensibly a history of the Carpenters' career as pop icons, it also doubles as a case study of an anorexic, beginning and ending with accounts of Karen's final days and recording in meticulous, and at times almost intrusive, detail her struggles with her weight and her self-image. Coleman avoids pathologizing Karen or offering pat explanations for her condition. Instead, he impartially weaves together commentary, ranging from the affectionate to the critical, about Karen and Richard's lives and careers from the various viewpoints of family members, friends and associates, including Richard Carpenter himself. Well-researched, well-written and less gossipy than most celebrity bios, this offers insights into the workings of the music industry.

The American Struggle explores Jacob Lawrence's radical way of transforming history into art by looking at his thirty panel series of paintings, Struggle . . . from the History of the American People (1954&#x2013;56). Essays by Steven Locke, Elizabeth Hutton Turner, Austen Barron Bailly, and Lydia Gordon mark the historic reunion of this series&#x2015;seen together in this exhibition for the first time since 1958. In entries on the panels, a multitude of voices responds to the episodes representing struggle from American history that Lawrence chose to activate in his series. The American Struggle reexamines Lawrence's lost narrative and its power for twenty-first century audiences by including contemporary art and artists. Derrick Adams, Bethany Collins, and Hank Willis Thomas invite us to reconsider history through themes of struggle in ways that resonate with Lawrence's artistic invention. Statements by these artists amplify how they and Lawrence view history not as distant period of the past but as an active imaginative space that is continuously questioned in the present tense and for future audiences.</p><p><p>[missing promotional headline]</p>With contributions by Derrick Adams, Sandy Alexandre, Rachel Allen, Austen Barron Bailly, Lonnie G.

At the heart of the volume are worked examples in a unique, two-column format that focuses on the basic strategies and step-by-step <i>thought processes</i> involved in problem solving&#x2014;with an emphasis on the <i>relationship</i> between the physical concepts and their mathematical expression. Color-coded drawings help readers visualize physics problems, and companion photographs show the same principle at work in different physical contexts, or juxtapose situations in which contrasting principles are at work. Real-world physics applications abound. <b></b> Covers the full spectrum of topics in Mechanics, Thermal Physics, Electromagnetism, Light and Optics, and Modern Physics. <b></b> For anyone needing an introduction to, or refresher of, algebra-based physics. </p></p><p><p> <b><i>James S. Walker.</i></b> James Walker obtained his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Washington in 1978. He subsequently served as a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of California at San Diego before joining the physics faculty at Washington State University in 1983. Professor Walker's research interests include statistical mechanics, critical phenomena, and chaos. His many publications on the application of renormalization-group theory to systems ranging from absorbed monolayers to binary-fluid mixtures have appeared in <i>Physical Review, Physical Review Letters, Physica,</i> and a host of other publications. He has also participated in observations on the summit of Mauna Kea, looking for evidence of extra-solar planets. </p> <p> Jim Walker likes to work with students at all levels, from judging elementary school science fairs to writing research papers with graduate students, and has taught introductory physics for many years. His enjoyment of this course and his empathy for students have earned him a reputation as an innovative, enthusiastic, and effective teacher. Jim's educational publications include "Reappearing Phases" (<i>Scientific American,</i> May 1987) as well as articles in the <i>American Journal of Physics</i> and <i>The Physics Teacher.</i> In recognition of his contributions to the teaching of physics, Jim was named Boeing Distinguished Professor of Science and Mathematics Education for 2001-2003. </p> <p> When he is not writing, conducting research, teaching, or developing new classroom demonstrations and pedagogical materials, Jim enjoys amateur astronomy, bird watching, photography, juggling, unicycling, boogie boarding, and kayaking. Jim is also an avid jazz pianist and organist. He has served as ballpark organist for several Class A minor league baseball teams, including minor league affiliates of the Seattle Mariners and San Francisco Giants. </p><p><b>To the Instructor</b></p> <p> Teaching introductory algebra-based physics can be a most challenging and rewarding experience. Students enter the course with a wide range of backgrounds, interests, and skills and we, the instructors, strive not only to convey the basic concepts and fundamental laws of physics, but also to give students an appreciation of its relevance and appeal. </p> <p> I wrote this book to help with that task. It incorporates a number of unique and innovative pedagogical features that evolved from years of teaching experience. The materials have been tested extensively in the classroom and in focus groups, and refined based on comments from students and teachers who used the first edition. The enthusiastic response I received from users of the first edition was both flattering and motivating. The second edition has been enhanced and enriched in response to this feedback. </p> <p><b>Learning Tools in the Text</b></p> <p> A key goal of this text is to help students make the connection between a conceptual understanding of physics and the various skills necessary to solve quantitative problems. One of the chief means to that end is the replacement of traditional "textbook". Examples with an integrated suite of learning tools: fully worked <i>Examples with Solutions in Two-Column Format, Active Examples, Conceptual Checkpoints,</i> and <i>Exercises.</i> Each of these tools performs some of the functions of a standard Example, but each is specialized to meet the needs of students at a particular point in the development of a chapter. </p> <p> These needs are not always the same. Sometimes students require a detailed explanation of how to tackle a particular problem; at other times, they must be allowed to take an active role and work out the details for themselves. Sometimes it is important for them to perform calculations and concentrate on numerical precision; at other times it is more fruitful for them to explore a key idea in a conceptual context. And sometimes, all that is required is practice using a new equation or definition. </p> <p> A good teacher can sense when students need a patient, step-by-step exposition and when they need only minimal reinforcement; when they need to focus on concepts and when they need an opportunity to practice their quantitative skills. This text attempts to emulate the teaching style of successful instructors by providing the right tool at the right time and place. </p> <p><b>Worked Examples with Solutions in Two-Column Format</b></p> <p> <i>Examples</i> model the most complete and detailed method of solving a particular type of problem. The Examples in this text are presented in a format that focuses on the basic strategies and thought processes involved in problem solving. The aim of this approach is to help students first visualize the situation, devise a <i>strategy</i> to be followed, and then implement a clear <i>step-by-step solution</i> to the problem. This focus on the intimate relationship between conceptual insights and problem-solving techniques encourages students to view the ability to solve problems as a logical outgrowth of conceptual understanding rather than a kind of parlor trick. </p> <p> Each Example has the same basic structure: </p> <ul> <li><b>Picture the Problem.</b> This first step discusses how the physical situation can be represented visually and what such a representation can tell us about how to analyze and solve the problem. At this step, always accompanied by a figure, we set up a coordinate system where appropriate, label important quantities, and indicate which values are known. The <i>Picture the Problem</i> steps have been enhanced in the second edition to make them more instructive. </li><li><b>Strategy.</b> Closely linked with this visualization process is the formulation of a <i>Strategy</i> to be followed in solving the problem. The strategy addresses the commonly asked question, "How do I get started?" by providing a clear overview of the problem and helping students to identify the relevant physical principles. It then guides the student in using known relationships to map a step-by-step path to the solution. </li><li><b>Solution in Two Column Format.</b> In the step-by-step <i>Solution</i> of the problem, each of the steps is presented with a prose statement in the left-hand column and the corresponding mathematical implementation in the right-hand column. Each step clearly translates the idea described in words into the appropriate equations. When reviewing an Example, note that the left-hand column gives the flow of ideas used in the solution; the right-hand column gives the mathematical calculations that were carried out.</li> <li><b>Insight.</b> Each Example wraps up with an <i>Insight</i> a comment regarding the solution just obtained. Some Insights deal with possible alternative solution techniques, others with new ideas suggested by the results.</li> <li><b>Practice Problem.</b> Following the Insight is a <i>Practice Problem,</i> which gives the student a chance to practice the type of calculation just presented. The Practice Problems, always accompanied by their answers, provide students with a valuable check on their understanding of the material. Finally, each Example ends with a reference to some related end-of-chapter problems to allow students to test their skills further.</li> </ul> <p><b>Active Examples</b></p> <p> <i>Active Examples</i> serve as a bridge between the fully worked Examples, in which every detail is fully discussed and every step is given, and the homework Problems, where no help is given at all. In an Active Example, students take an active role in solving the problem by thinking through the logic of the steps described on the left and checking their answers on the right. Students often find it useful to practice problem solving by covering one column of an Active Example with a sheet of paper and filling in the covered steps as they refer to the other column. In the second edition, follow-up questions, called Your Turns, ask students to look at the problem in a slightly different way. Answers to Your Turns, are provided at the end of the book. Working through Active Examples will make students better prepared to tackle homework problems on their own. </p> <p><b>Conceptual Checkpoints</b></p> <p> <i>Conceptual Checkpoints</i> help students sharpen their insight into key physical principles. A typical Conceptual Checkpoint presents a thought-provoking question that can be answered by logical reasoning based on physical concepts rather than by numerical calculations. These questions, which can be just as challenging as any numerical problem and just as educational, are presented in multiple-choice format to help focus the student's thinking. The statement of the question is followed by a detailed discussion and analysis in the section titled <i>Reasoning and Discussion,</i> and the <i>Answer</i> is given at the end of the checkpoint for quick and easy reference. </p> <p><b>Exercises</b></p> <p> <i>Exercises</i> present brief calculations designed to illustrate the application of important new relationships, without the expenditure of time and space required by a fully worked Example. Exercises generally give students an opportunity to practice the use of a new equation, become familiar with the units of a new physical quantity, and get a feeling for typical magnitudes. </p> <p><b>Problem Solving Notes</b></p> <p> In addition to the in-text elements just described, each chapter includes a number of marginal <i>Problem Solving Notes.</i> These practical hints are designed to highlight useful problem-solving methods while helping students avoid common pitfalls Remember to measure angles in radians and misconceptions. </p> <p><b>End of Chapter Learning Tools</b></p> <p> The end of chapter material in this text also includes a number of innovations, along with refinements of more familiar elements. </p> <p><b>Chapter Summary</b></p> <p> Each chapter concludes with a Chapter Summary presented in an easy-to-use outline style. Key concepts and equations are organized by topic for convenient reference. </p> <p><b>Problem-Solving Summary</b></p> <p> A unique feature of this text is the <i>Problem-Solving Summary</i> at the end of the chapter. This is a new type of summary that addresses common sources of misconceptions in problem solving, and gives specific references to Examples and Active Examples illustrating the correct procedures. Organized by type of problem, each entry in the Problem-Solving Summary relates a specific type of calculation to the relevant physical concepts. </p> <p><b>Conceptual Questions</b></p> <p> The homework for each chapter begins with a section of <i>Conceptual Questions.</i> Answers to the odd-numbered questions can be found in the back of the book, so that students can check their reasoning and conclusions. Answers to even-numbered Conceptual Questions are available in the Instructor's Solutions Manual. </p> <p><b>Numerical and Integrated Homework Problems</b></p> <p> A collection of numerical and Integrated Problems are presented at the end of each chapter. Note that a number of problems are given for each section of the chapter. In addition, a section titled "General Problems" presents a variety of problems that use material from two or more sections within the chapter, or refer to material covered in earlier chapters. </p> <p> The difficulty of Problems is ranked using one, two, or three blue dots. The most straightforward Problems are labeled with a single dot (�), Problems involving several steps and more detailed reasoning are labeled with two dots (��), and Problems of a more challenging nature are indicated with three dots (���). </p> <p> Problems of special biological or medical relevance are indicated with the symbol <b>BIO.</b> </p> <p> Problems throughout the homework, labeled with the symbol <b>IP,</b> <i>integrate a conceptual question with a numerical problem.</i> Problems of this type, which stress the importance of reasoning from basic principles, show how conceptual insight and numerical calculation go hand in hand in physics.

Taking advantage of documentary evidence that has emerged, particularly since the quincentenary of the artist&#39;s death in 1992, Piero scholar Marilyn Aronberg Lavin covers all aspects of the career of an artist who can justifiably be called a &#34;Renaissance Man&#34;. Born in Sansepolcro, a small town on the border between Umbria and Tuscany, Piero della Francesca worked there periodically throughout his life. But he also travelled elsewhere in Italy - to Florence and Rome for brief periods, and to Urbino (the location of his famous &#34;Flagellation&#34;), Arezzo (&#34;Legend of the True Cross&#34; fresco cycle), Rimini and Ferrara. He was well respected and worked for the provincial rulers in these cities. However, his fame was not just due to his skill as a painter. Concurrently, he pursued his interest in mathematics and wrote three treatises on the subject. This work was linked to his artistic output - the application of the rules of perspective in his compositions, with their structured spaces and idealized shapes, are one of the reasons why he has become so univesally admired and studied in the modern era.</p><p></p><h2>Lewis Carroll&#39;s The Hunting of the Snark: The Annotated Snark</h2><p>Pp 129 + facsimile of original hunting of the snark book. &#34; Lewis Carroll (1832-1898), the pen name of Oxford mathematician, logician, photographer and author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, is famous the world over for his fantastic classics &#34;Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland,&#34; &#34;Through the Looking Glass,&#34; &#34;The Hunting of the Snark,&#34; &#34;Jabberwocky,&#34; and &#34;Sylvie and Bruno.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Managerial and Organizational Reality</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Written to introduce readers to the experiences people have in organizations, this book provides a reality-based perspective on the everyday happenings in organizations at all professional levels.<b> </b> With current and informative readings that provoke reflection and discussion, this book gives readers a real-world overview of organizational behavior from executive managerial levels to those of lower level participants. <b> </b> For professionals with a career in organizational behavior, management, business relations, organizational psychology, communications, public relations, education, and social work. </p></p><p><p> <b> <i>Peter J.

Seinfeld needed David&#x2019;s help with what could be the biggest opportunity of his career so far, and this turned out to be the perfect place to discuss it.<br> <br>They had come to Lee&#x2019;s Market on First Avenue and Seventy-Eighth Street, maybe for some snacks, maybe for material. The mundane tasks of life and comic gold often merged into one for them. Sure enough, they soon were making fun of the products they found among the fluorescent-lit aisles. Korean jelly, for instance: Why, exactly, did it have to come in a jelly form? Was there also, perhaps, a foam or a spray? The strange foods on the steam table: Who ate those? &#x201c;This is the kind of discussion you don&#x2019;t see on TV,&#x201d; David said.<br> <br>Seinfeld had told David a bit of news over the course of the evening: NBC was interested in doing a show with him. Some executive had brought him in for a meeting and everything. Seinfeld didn&#x2019;t have any ideas for television. He just wanted to be himself and do his comedy. He felt David might be a good brainstorming partner.<br> <br>Seinfeld and David had a common sensibility, in part because of their similar backgrounds: Both had grown up in the New York area and were raised Jewish. Both seized on observational humor for their acts. They had their differences, too, that balanced each other nicely: Seinfeld was thirty-four and on the rise thanks to his genial, inoffensive approach to comedy and his intense drive to succeed. David was far more caustic and sensitive to the slightest audience infractions (not listening, not laughing at the right moments, not laughing enough). He was older, forty-one, and struggling on the stand-up circuit because of his propensity to antagonize his audiences out of a rather explosive brand of insecurity.<br> <br>Seinfeld had dark hair blown dry into the classic &#x2019;80s pouf, while David maintained a magnificent Jew-fro, dented a bit in the middle by his receding hairline. Seinfeld&#x2019;s delivery often ascended to a high-pitched warble; David favored a guttural grumble that could become a yell without warning.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d first become friends in the bar of Catch a Rising Star in the late &#x2019;70s when Seinfeld started out as a comic. From then on, they couldn&#x2019;t stop talking. They loved to fixate on tiny life annoyances, in their conversations and their comedy. Soon they started helping each other with their acts and became friendly outside of work.<br> <br>Seinfeld had gotten big laughs by reading David&#x2019;s stand-up material at a birthday party for mutual friend Carol Leifer&#x2014;one of the few women among their band (or any band) of New York comedians. David, nearly broke, had given Leifer some jokes as a birthday &#x201c;gift.&#x201d; Too drunk to read them aloud, she handed them off to Seinfeld; he killed, which suggested some creative potential between the two men.<br> <br>As a result, it made sense for Seinfeld to approach David with this TV &#x201c;problem&#x201d; he now had. David also remained the only &#x201c;writer&#x201d; Seinfeld knew, someone who had, as Seinfeld said, &#x201c;actually typed something out on a piece of paper&#x201d; when he churned out bits for sketch shows like Fridays and Saturday Night Live.<br> <br>Seinfeld was smart to consult David on this TV thing. David did have a vision, if not a particularly grand one. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; David said as they bantered in Lee&#x2019;s Market, &#x201c;is what the show should be.&#x201d; Seinfeld was intrigued.<br> <br>The next night, after their comedy sets at the Improv in Midtown, David and Seinfeld went to the Westway Diner around the corner, at Forty-Fourth Street and Ninth Avenue. At about midnight, they settled into a booth and riffed on the possibilities: What about a special that simply depicted where comics get their material? Jerry could play himself in that, for sure. Cameras could document him going through his day, having conversations like the one at the market the night before; he&#x2019;d later put those insights into his act, which audiences would see at the end of the special. As they brainstormed, Seinfeld had one cup of coffee, then two. He usually didn&#x2019;t drink coffee at all. They were onto something.<br> <br>Seinfeld liked the idea enough to take it to NBC. The network signed off on it, suggesting a ninety-minute special called Seinfeld&#x2019;s Stand-Up Diary that would air in Saturday Night Live&#x2019;s time slot during an off week. As he thought about it, though, Seinfeld worried about filling an entire ninety minutes; thirty minutes, on the other hand, he could do.<br> <br>By the time he and David had written a thirty-minute script, in February 1989, they realized they had a sitcom on their hands instead of a special. Jerry and a Larry-like guy could serve as the two main characters, who would discuss the minutiae of their lives and turn it into comedy&#x2014;like Harold Pinter or Samuel Beckett for television. &#x201c;Two guys talking,&#x201d; Seinfeld said. &#x201c;This was the idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>To that setup, they added a neighbor. David told Seinfeld about his own eccentric neighbor, Kenny Kramer&#x2014;a jobless schemer with whom David shared a car, a TV, and one pair of black slacks in case either had a special occasion. He would be the basis for the third character. They set the first scene in a fictional coffee shop like the one where they&#x2019;d hatched their idea, and called it Pete&#x2019;s Luncheonette.<br> <br><br> <br>SEINFELDIA&#x2019;S FOUNDING FATHER AND NAMESAKE got his first inkling that he was funny at age eight. Little Jerry Seinfeld was sitting on a stoop with a friend in his middle-class town on Long Island, eating milk and cookies. Jerry&#x2014;usually a dorky, shy kid&#x2014;said something funny enough to cause his friend to spit milk and cookies back into Jerry&#x2019;s face and hair. Jerry thought, I would like to do this professionally.<br> <br>Seinfeld was born in Brooklyn but grew up in Massapequa. He spent his childhood watching Laugh-In, Batman, The Honeymooners, and Get Smart. (&#x201c;When I heard that they were going to do a sitcom with a secret agent who was funny, the back of my head blew off,&#x201d; he later said.) His parents, Betty and Kal, made humor a priority in their home. His father, a sign merchant, told jokes often. Even his business&#x2019;s name was a joke: Kal Signfeld Signs.<br> <br>As Jerry came into his own sense of humor, his performances grew more elaborate than mere jokes on the stoop. At Birch Lane Elementary School, he planned and starred in a skit for a class fair with his friend Lawrence McCue. Jerry played President Kennedy, and Lawrence played a reporter who asked him questions&#x2014;essentially, set up his jokes. They were the only ones at the fair who did a comedy routine. When Jerry graduated to Massapequa High School in 1968, he grew obsessed with two things: cars and the comedian Bill Cosby. He dabbled in acting, playing Julius Caesar in his tenth-grade English class. But comedy remained his focus. He saw even geometry class as training for comedy; a good joke, he felt, had the same rigorous internal logic as a theorem proof. The only difference was the silly twist at the end of a joke.<br> <br>When a long-haired Jerry Seinfeld attended Queens College, he acted in school productions and hung around the New York comedy clubs, wearing white sneakers like his idols Joe Namath and Cosby (circa the comedian&#x2019;s time on the &#x2019;60s show I Spy). As he waited to get up the nerve to pursue stand-up as a profession, he used his attendance at Manhattan comedy clubs as a kind of independent study. He analyzed comics&#x2019; approach to their material and even wrote a forty-page paper on the subject.<br> <br>He started to know the players: He eavesdropped, for instance, on Larry David talking to another comedian. David happened to be leaning on Seinfeld&#x2019;s car, a 1973 Fiat 128 SL, in front of the Improv one day in 1975, the first time Seinfeld ever saw his future writing partner. Seinfeld was impressed with these guys&#x2019; dedication to the profession. He didn&#x2019;t dare speak to them yet.<br> <br>After he graduated in 1976 as an honor student, Seinfeld applied his sense of discipline to becoming a stand-up, approaching it methodically. His first appearance on a professional stage as a comedian was at Catch a Rising Star in 1976, at age twenty-two. He&#x2019;d practiced his routine with a bar of soap until he had every word memorized. Comedian Elayne Boosler introduced him, and he took the stage. Once he got there, though, he couldn&#x2019;t remember a word. He stood there for several long seconds, not saying a thing. Finally, he remembered the subjects he&#x2019;d planned to talk about, so, without anything else to say, he listed them to the audience: &#x201c;the beach, driving, parents.&#x201d; People laughed, thinking this was his act, some high-concept performance art. Eventually he managed to fill three minutes with bits of material until he escaped the spotlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Jerry Seinfeld,&#x201d; Boosler quipped to the audience when it ended, &#x201c;the king of the segue.&#x201d;<br> <br>For four years, Seinfeld walked around the city night after night to hit clubs. He&#x2019;d go eighteen months in a row without one night off. He tape-recorded his routines, then analyzed them to improve by the next night. He also fell in love with The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which became a favorite among New York City comics in the &#x2019;80s because its syndicated reruns aired after Late Night with David Letterman, dovetailing with the time they got home from work. They talked about the previous night&#x2019;s episode when they saw one another at clubs, sometimes making dirty jokes about Mary and Rhoda.<br> <br>In 1979, after three years on the circuit, Seinfeld got what could have been a big break. He was cast as a recurring character on the hit sitcom Benson, a mail delivery guy named Frankie who did comedy routines no one wanted to hear. (The five-foot-eleven-inch comedian would bound into Benson&#x2019;s living-room set with an attempted catchphrase: &#x201c;Give a cheer, Frankie&#x2019;s here!&#x201d;) After three episodes, however, he showed up for a read-through and found no script waiting with his name on it. When he asked what was going on, an assistant director pulled him aside to tell him: He&#x2019;d been fired.<br> <br>Still, by the early &#x2019;80s, Seinfeld was secure in his position on the comedy circuit. He knew his brand. As he told teenage interviewer Judd Apatow, who hosted a show called Club Comedy on the Syosset High School radio station on Long Island, it took time to develop the skills that led to great observational jokes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one thing to see something,&#x201d; Seinfeld said, &#x201c;and another thing to do something with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He would start with something that struck him as funny&#x2014;it could be something as small as a silly word&#x2014;and then work on it until he conveyed what he found so funny about it to his audience. The first line of a joke always had to be funny. Then he went from there, from funny thought to funny thought with the fewest possible unfunny thoughts in between, until it got to the absolute biggest laugh at the end. He was focused only on making people laugh, nothing else. &#x201c;Funny is the world I live in,&#x201d; he later said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re funny, I&#x2019;m interested. You&#x2019;re not funny, I&#x2019;m not interested.&#x201d;<br> <br>By the time he chatted with young Apatow in the early &#x2019;80s, he was playing clubs in New York, Atlantic City, and elsewhere. Apatow asked him, &#x201c;Where do you go from here? How much farther can you get?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot you can do,&#x201d; Seinfeld said. &#x201c;You can do a sitcom, which is something a lot of people don&#x2019;t want to be associated with. I&#x2019;m going to do some acting. But stand-up is what I am. The acting will be to improve my visibility.&#x201d; When Apatow asked what &#x201c;success&#x201d; meant to Seinfeld, the comedian had a clear and simple answer: &#x201c;To be considered one of the best stand-up comics.&#x201d;<br> <br>Around the same time as his interview with Apatow, Seinfeld hit the big time: his first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1981. For him it was &#x201c;the Olympics, the Super Bowl, and the World Series all rolled into one,&#x201d; he later said. He edited his usual twenty-minute set down to its best five minutes, then practiced it at clubs five or six times a night, repeating it probably two hundred times before his big debut. He jogged to get into top physical condition. He played tapes of the Superman theme to psych himself up.<br> <br>Kal Seinfeld made a sign that he placed on his van the week before his son&#x2019;s appearance. In black letters over orange and green paint, it said: JERRY SEINFELD OF MASSAPEQUA WILL BE ON CARSON SPECIAL. Kal also took out an ad in the local paper to announce the occasion.<br> <br>The actual performance flew by for Jerry like a downhill roller coaster. He riffed on complex turn lanes, the 1,400-pound man in The Guinness Book of World Records, and weather reports: &#x201c;They show you the satellite photo. This is real helpful, a photograph of the earth from ten thousand miles away. Can you tell if you should take a sweater or not from that shot?&#x201d; Better yet, he earned laughs in all the right places, some spontaneous applause, and an &#x201c;OK&#x201d; sign from Carson himself.<br> <br>The appearance would lead to several more on Carson&#x2019;s show as well as Late Night with David Letterman. Seinfeld later called being on Carson &#x201c;the difference between thinking you&#x2019;re a comedian and really being one.&#x201d; Seinfeld would not have to do any more embarrassing bit parts on sitcoms.<br> <br>In 1984, though, he did go back to acting, as he&#x2019;d predicted when speaking to Apatow. This time, his prospects looked a little better. There he was, a lanky young man with a whoosh of dark hair, slick as ever in a black suit, black tie, and white shirt as he sat behind a network-executive desk in a Showtime movie that satirized the TV business, The Ratings Game. &#x201c;The networks aren&#x2019;t buying Italians, Jews, Puerto Ricans this season,&#x201d; he says as he swigs milk and eats chocolate cookies. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re buying gays, alcoholics, child molesters.&#x201d;<br> <br>A few years later came one more chance in television. In 1988, a new production company named Castle Rock considered casting Seinfeld in a sitcom pilot called Past Imperfect for ABC. Ultimately, the network rejected him because of his lack of acting experience, and the part went to another stand-up, Howie Mandel, but the pilot never aired.<br> <br>Seinfeld segued back into full-time stand-up, doing up to three hundred appearances per year across the country. He had regular spots on The Tonight Show. He had a comfortable life and didn&#x2019;t seem concerned with fame.<br> <br>As it turned out, however, those last two experiences in television&#x2014;his Showtime role and his almost-pilot&#x2014;were prophetic. The Ratings Game included Seinfeld&#x2019;s future Seinfeld costar, Michael Richards; Seinfeld&#x2019;s line anticipated how NBC executives would later object to his own sitcom creation&#x2014;the part about the Jews, at least. And his relationship with Castle Rock would prove critical when it came time to produce his own sitcom.<br> <br><br> <br>LARRY DAVID WAS WHAT&#x2019;S KNOWN as a comic&#x2019;s comic, an acquired taste, &#x201c;which mea...</p><h2>Live Faithfully: A Study in the Book of James (Fresh Life Series)</h2><p><b>The ninth book in the 20-minute Fresh Life Bible Study Series, <i>Live Faithfully </i>looks at the practical wisdom of James. </b>The brother of Jesus and a leader in the Jerusalem church, James wanted to make sure his readers understood how to live what they believed.&nbsp;<i>Live Faithfully </i>is written for any woman who has asked, <i>Am I living what I&#x2019;ve learned in the Bible?

Paul, Marguerite's friend and love interest, has changed since his soul split in four, and he struggles with his dark side, pushing Marguerite away while also trying to assist her across the multiverse. With fast-paced action that starts from the first chapter, this title will draw readers into an enthralling chase across time and space. The plot cleverly connects many universes with multiple dimensions of personality, and the characters are intriguing, smart, layered, and independent. Although this offering can be read as a stand-alone, those who haven't read the first two novels will lack important context. VERDICT Sci-fi fans are the obvious audience for this, but readers of all genres will enjoy the nonstop action and unique story.&#x2014;Melissa Poole, Clemson University Library, Anderson, SC</p><h2>The Eagles&#39; War: The Saga of the Eagle Squadron Pilots 1940-1945</h2><p>The Eagles&#39; War The Saga of the Eagle Squadron Pilots 1940-1945 [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Jailbird</h2><p>Pay attention please to the life of Walter F.

In this revisionist account, Eric Nelson argues that a great many of our &#x201c;founding fathers&#x201d; saw themselves as rebels against the British Parliament, not the Crown. <i>The Royalist Revolution</i> interprets the patriot campaign of the 1770s as an insurrection in favor of royal power&#x2015;driven by the conviction that the Lords and Commons had usurped the just prerogatives of the monarch.</p><p>Leading patriots believed that the colonies were the king&#x2019;s own to govern, and they urged George III to defy Parliament and rule directly. These theorists were proposing to turn back the clock on the English constitution, rejecting the Whig settlement that had secured the supremacy of Parliament after the Glorious Revolution. Instead, they embraced the political theory of those who had waged the last great campaign against Parliament&#x2019;s &#x201c;usurpations&#x201d;: the reviled Stuart monarchs of the seventeenth century.</p><p>When it came time to design the state and federal constitutions, the very same figures who had defended this expansive conception of royal authority&#x2015;John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, James Wilson, and their allies&#x2015;returned to the fray as champions of a single executive vested with sweeping prerogatives. As a result of their labors, the Constitution of 1787 would assign its new president far more power than any British monarch had wielded for almost a hundred years. On one side of the Atlantic, Nelson concludes, there would be kings without monarchy; on the other, monarchy without kings.</p></p><p>Eric Nelson is Robert M. Beren Professor of Government at Harvard University.[A] brilliant and provocative analysis of the American Revolution... [Nelson] departs radically from his predecessors, arguing that it was admiration for royal prerogative power and belief in the virtues of a strong executive, both derived from seventeenth-century precedents, that fostered the rebellion against Britain and shaped the Constitution of the new American republic. His Revolution comes out of a royalist, not a parliamentarian, tradition. <i>The Royalist Revolution</i> is a book of great intellectual power: it is not just challenging but erudite (many of its abundant footnotes are brilliant short essays in their own right), and, though densely argued, is written with admirable clarity and fairness. (John Brewer <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br><i>The Royalist Revolution</i> is a thought-provoking book, and Nelson is to be commended for reviving discussion of the complex ideology of the American Revolution. He reminds us that there was a spectrum of opinion even among the most ardent patriots and a deep British influence on the political institutions of the new country. (Andrew O&#x2019;Shaughnessy <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>By the 1760s, parliament was imposing taxes on the colonists without their consent. Patriot leaders like John Adams expressed longing for George III to restrain the legislative tyranny of parliament. Generations of historians have largely regarded such statements as insincere rhetorical ploys&#x2015;as arguments of convenience lodged and then quickly forgotten. Nelson makes a convincing case that in so doing, historians have overlooked an important part of the political philosophy that impelled the American Revolution. (Yoni Appelbaum <i>The Atlantic</i>)<br><br>A scrupulous archaeology of American revolutionary thought. (Thomas Meaney <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>[Nelson&#x2019;s] argument will alternately surprise, shock, distress, and outrage many scholars, but it will also help to reshape a debate about the origins of the presidency, a topic that gravely matters as we agonize over the role of the post-9/11 executive in our impassioned and impasse-ridden politics... Eric Nelson&#x2019;s real genius is to force us to rethink both the origins and substance of critical political ideas... We will be wrestling with the implications of its argument for some time. (Jack N. Rakove <i>Weekly Standard</i>)<br><br>Eric Nelson&#x2019;s new book advances the royalist reinterpretation of 18th-century America a crucial stage further... <i>The Royalist Revolution</i>...provide[s] a powerful double-barrelled challenge to historiographical orthodoxy. Nelson argues persuasively that the Revolution&#x2015;at least in the beginning&#x2015;was not a revolt against the supposed tyrant George III, but a rebellion against the claims of the British Parliament. (Colin Kidd <i>London Review of Books</i>)<br><br>For anyone interested in the founding of the American Republic it is indispensable reading. (Jeremy Jennings <i>Standpoint</i>)<br><br>Brilliantly argued... <i>The Royalist Revolution</i> is surely one of the most important works on Revolutionary era political thought to appear in many years. (John W. Compton <i>American Political Thought</i>)<br><br>Nelson has given us a text of monumental importance. It is clear that historians will not be able to ignore this significant contribution... <i>The Royalist Revolution</i> will make many of us think very hard about what we thought we knew. (Matthew Dziennik <i>Canadian Journal of History</i>)<br><br>Eric Nelson&#x2019;s provocative new work, <i>The Royalist Revolution: Monarchy and the American Founding</i>, represents an important contribution to our understanding of the framing of the Article II powers of the Presidency... Nelson is to be congratulated for his elegant and illuminating treatment of this important body of patriot revolutionary thought. He provides a persuasive rebuttal to the conventional wisdom... Nelson&#x2019;s discussion of the debate over the executive at Philadelphia will be of inestimable value to scholars of constitutional law and history. For it is here that he maps with great depth and subtlety the way that royal authority informed the Framers&#x2019; understanding of America&#x2019;s chief magistracy. And as scholars and statesmen alike continue to debate the scope of the President&#x2019;s discretionary authority, the ideas that helped shape the powers of the executive in 1787 become all the more relevant today.

Her affair with a younger and married man drew the enmity of a xenophobic French establishment, who denied her entry to the Academy of Sciences and tried to expel her from France. But she was determined to live life how she saw fit, and passed on her resilience to her daughters. Emling draws on personal letters released by Curie's only granddaughter to show how Marie influenced her daughters yet let them blaze their own paths. Irene followed her mother's footsteps into science and was instrumental in the discovery of nuclear fission. Eve traveled the world as a foreign correspondent and then moved on to humanitarian missions.</p><p> Emling also shows how Curie, following World War I, turned to America for help. Few people know about Curie's close friendship with American journalist Missy Meloney, who arranged speaking tours across the country for Marie and Eve and Irene. Months on the road, charming audiences both large and small, endeared the Curies to American women and established a lifelong relationship with the United States that formed one of the strongest connections of Marie's life. Without the financial support of American women, Marie might not have been able to go on with her research.</p><p> Continuing the family story into the third generation, Emling also interviews Marie Curie's granddaughter Helene Joliot-Curie, who is an accomplished physicist in her own right. She reveals why her grandmother was a lot more than just a scientist and how Marie's trips to America forever changed her. Factually rich, personal and original, this is an engrossing story about the most famous woman in science that rips the cover off the myth and reveals the real person, friend, and mother behind it.</p></p><p><p><b>Shelley Emling </b>has written for the <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today, Fortune</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, The Huffington Post,</i> FoxNews.com<i>,</i> Beliefnet.com<i>, The Christian Science Monitor,</i> and the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>.

In this engagingly delightful look behind the heavy skirts of the era, Shelley Emling reveals Marie's and her two disparate daughters' idiosyncratic family life, and especially the significant role that their visits to the United States played in their personal development.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Atkins, author of Galileo's Finger</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Marie Curie and Her Daughters </i>breathes life into an icon of science. Emling uses private letters, the unpublished papers of her daughter, Irene Curie, and an interview with her granddaughter Helene Langevin-Joliot to take the reader into Curie's role as the mother of two daughters, as a traveler to America and beyond, and as a woman in a man's world.

A book that should propel young women into science for the sheer fun of it, it's also a rich tale of war and peace, family commitment, friendship and medical progress.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adele Glimm, author of Gene Hunter and Rachel Carson</i></p><p>&#x201c;A must read for every woman and every female teenager. In accessible prose, Emling enlightens the world about this enigmatic scientist, and, with the help of personal letters shared by Curie's granddaughter, Emling has woven a story of a woman full of grace and of the daughters who loved her without fail.

Few other forces have so universally shaped the earth and patterns of human exploration. Jan DeBlieu brings a poet&#39;s voice and a scientist&#39;s eye to Wind, showing how the collision of a few molecules can lead to the creation of religions, the discovery of continents, the destruction of empires.</p><p>Jan DeBlieu lives on North Carolina's Outer Banks, where "wind is culture and heritage... Wind toughens us, moves mountains of sand as we watch, makes it difficult to sleepwalk through life." She always knows how fast the wind is blowing, and from what direction. She knows which winds are good for fishermen, and which are good for surfers. In <i>Wind</i>, DeBlieu teaches what she knows, and more. Watching the wind ruffle the water, turn tree branches into whips, or capsize a sailboat, she uses her powers of observation and lyrical writing to beautifully communicate what she sees. From the windy myths, religions, and creation stories of cultures worldwide, to the hardcore science of air movements and meteorology, to the stories of people whose lives are forever changed by hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes, <i>Wind</i> covers vast territory.<p> "I'd rather look at Grandma's drawers than see a backing wind," say folks on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Someone who is following an unlikely dream is said to be "chasing the wind." And if we suspect a big change is coming, we say, "something is in the wind." We name the winds: sirocco, Santa Ana, williwaw, chinook, monsoon. DeBlieu traces the ways wind shapes our reality, the earth's land and water, plants and animals, exploring everything in dramatic, immediate, and lucid prose.</p><p> "It begins with a subtle stirring caused by sunlight falling on the vapors that swaddle the earth. It is fueled by extremes--the stifling warmth of the tropics, the bitter chill of the poles. Temperature changes set the system in motion: hot air drifts upward and, as it cools, slowly descends.... Gradually the vapors begin to swirl as if trapped in a simmering cauldron. Air molecules are caught by suction and sent flying.... As the world spins, it brushes them to one side but does not slow them. Tumbling together, the particles of air become a huge, unstoppable current."</p><p> And so the winds are born. Read <i>Wind</i> and you'll never again take an exhilarating kite-flying day for granted. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Jan DeBlieu is the author of Hatteras Journal (1987) and Meant to Be Wild (1991), which was a Nature Book Club main selection and was chosen by the Library Journal as one of the three best natural history books of the year. She has also written for the New York Times Magazine, Smithsonian, Audobon, and Orion, and her essay on the wind, &#34;Onto the Dragon&#39;s Mouth,&#34; was featured in the inaugural volumn of American Nature Writing. She currently resides in Manteo, North California.</p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><p>&#x201c;It was from out the rind of one apple tasted that the knowledge of good and evil, as two twins cleaving together, leaped forth into the world. And perhaps this is that doom which Adam fell into of knowing good and evil, that is to say, of knowing good by evil.&#x201d;&#x2013; from Milton&#x2019;s Areopagitica In his epic work Paradise Lost, John Milton seeks &#x201c;to justify the ways of God to men&#x201d; through the familiar Christian story of the fall from grace. The poem is imbued with Milton&#x2019;s profoundly individual view of man&#x2019;s place in the universe and his intellectual and spiritual quest for redemption in the face of despair. Since its creation Paradise Lost has provided inspiration for generations of writers, from the Romantic poets to Tolkien and, most recently, Philip Pullman in His Dark Materials trilogy. Countless generations of ordinary readers have similarly had their understanding of the darker nature of the human soul illuminated by this remarkable work. In this edition the poem is presented with all 12 magnificent illustrations produced by William Blake specially for the work.</p><p>This is the first fully-annotated, old-spelling edition of Paradise Lost to be published in this century. It surveys in its introduction and incorporates in its notes the large amount of criticism published between 1965 and the present--not to mention the criticism that began with Dryden, Addison, Samuel Johnson, and William Blake--and it reflects critical perspectives from New Criticism to Deconstruction, from Philology to New Historicism and Feminism. On the page, the book combines the look and feel of original editions with the convenience of wide margins and thorough annotation.John Milton (9 December 1608 &#x2013; 8 November 1674) was an English poet.</p><h2>Teen Torment: Overcoming Verbal Abuse at Home and at School</h2><p>The author of The Verbally Abusive Relationship shows teenagers how to identify and overcome verbal abuse and bullying wherever they manifest themselves. Original.</p><p>Patricia Evans is a highly acclaimed interpersonal communications specialist, public speaker, and consultant. She has appeared on hundreds of radio shows and dozens of television programs, including Oprah and CNN. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area in California.Evans is the author of several books about verbal abuse, beginning with <i>The Verbally Abusive Relationship</i> (1992). Here she targets the minefields of teen behavior in a book for parents, teachers, and teens to share. In her first section, which defines verbal abuse, Evans revisits some of the material in her previous titles, but she shows how teens are particularly affected: verbal abuse impairs the self-confidence and self-knowledge necessary to develop into healthy, functioning adults. And she discusses the role of verbal abuse in violent behavior. In the book's second half, Evans looks specifically at verbal abuse in the media, on the sports field, at home, and in school, and she closes with a section on stopping verbal abuse, with separate chapters for parents, teachers, teens, and "boyfriends and girlfriends." Evans' approach is more practical and anecdotal than scientific, using approachable language enhanced with plenty of checklists, charts, and an appended resources section. The result is an easily digested, empowering guide to identifying and curbing damaging behavior and to strengthening communication in general. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It's just a simple, fast language."</p> <p><b>O'Reilly Media:</b> What made you write the book?<br> <b>Ben Klemens:</b> I kept having the same conversation, with the same disconnect. I would talk about how I was having an easy time writing code in C, and the person I was talking to would tell me that doing so is impossible, because everything needs to be written from scratch and there is endless declaration and memory management cruft obscuring the real flow of the code. Finally, I got a friend to concede that maybe I wasn't hallucinating, and maybe I really was writing C code in reasonable time and with reasonable clarity, and he asked me, "OK, so can you refer me to a textbook that teaches C with a modern style?" And finally, I understood the disconnect, because I couldn't find such a text. Everything I read was at least a decade old and had a section teaching you how to re-implement linked lists yet again. The C standard was revised in 1999, allowing for a much more flowing writing style, yet these books still presented code with a halting and obtuse style.</p> <p> <b>ORM:</b> Why is your book especially important now?<br> <b>BK:</b> I should've written it five years ago.</p> <p> <b>ORM:</b> What is on the horizon for your readers?<br> <b>BK:</b> I have it easy here, because C is still immensely common. You can find measures that say that it is the most popular computing language, and some that rank it at maybe No. 2 or No. 3. What makes this amazing about our 40-year-old friend is that it has no corporation or foundation pushing it, no trademarked logos, no ad budget, and no designers on perpetual book tour. It's just a simple, fast language. And it's not going away very quickly. I have no idea what we'll be writing 50 years from now, but I'm pretty confident that in five or 10 years, we'll still be writing a lot of C code. Also, C is still the lingua franca of computing. So many languages have a back door that lets you write some code in C, so even people who long ago decided to avoid C eventually find themselves writing little snippets in it.</p> <p> By the way, I'm obviously a satisfied user, but I come neither to praise or to bury C. The language has warts, many of which I point out in the book along the way to pointing out its better features.</p> <p> <b>ORM:</b> What is the single most important take-away from your book?<br> <b>BK:</b> Use libraries. If you don't know how to link to a binary tree library, you are doomed to write your own binary tree implementation. I think a lot of the people who think everything in C has to be written from scratch have just never learned how to reliably link their code to the wealth of existing libraries.</p> <p> <b>ORM:</b> Who is your intended audience?<br> <b>BK:</b> I have two. </p><ul> <li>People who only know a smattering of C, which they picked up on the street.</li> <li>People who learned C from a more traditional textbook, and know that they need to update from how C was written in the 1980s. Probably included here are CS majors who were traumatized by their college C textbook and decided they hate C, that it is an unmerciful disaster, and so begins a downward spiral where they avoid writing in C, so when they do have some C-based problem it is a melancholy burden, so after getting that done they avoid writing any more C for as long as possible and thus their skills get rustier. This book can help to break the cycle.</li> </ul><p></p><p>Ben Klemens has been doing statistical analysis and computationally-intensive modeling of populations ever since getting his PhD in Social Sciences from Caltech.

Challenging this idea, the late Sir Roger Mynors argues that the poem's true subject is humanity and its place in nature and society. The poem is also a landmark in the use of the natural world as material for literature and of special interest because the poet draws not only on his own experience but also on his wide reading of Greek poetry. This commentary examines Virgil's meaning and choice of expression to provide a fuller understanding of the poetry.<br></p><p>Virgil&#39;s Georgics, by common consent one of the great poems of Western literature, purports to be a didactic poem on agriculture, but its true subject is man and his place in nature and society. It is also a landmark in the use of the natural world as material for literature, and in the history of man&#39;s attitude to his environment. The poem is of special interest because Virgil brings to bear his own sympathetic understanding as well as his wide reading in Greek and Latin literature. This definitive commentary by the late Sir Roger Mynors presents the poet&#39;s meaning in such away as to bring about a fuller understanding and enjoyment of the poetry, and should be an invaluable companion for all serious students of Latin literature.Virgil was an ancient Roman poet, the author of the Eclogues, the Georgics and the Aeneid, the last being an epic poem of twelve books that became the Roman Empire&#39;s national epic.

The criminal justice system-and especially the age-old law of vagrancy-played a key role not only in maintaining safety and order but also in enforcing conventional standards of morality and propriety. A person could be arrested for sporting a beard, making a speech, or working too little. Yet by the end of the 1960s, vagrancy laws were discredited and American society was fundamentally transformed. What happened? In <em>Vagrant Nation</em>, Risa Goluboff provides a groundbreaking account of this transformation. By reading into the history of the 1960s through the lens of vagrancy laws, Goluboff shows how constitutional challenges to long-standing police practices were at the center of the multiple movements that made "the 1960s." Vagrancy laws were so broad and flexible that they made it possible for the police to arrest anyone out of place in any way: Beats and hippies; Communists and Vietnam War protestors; racial minorities, civil rights activists, and interracial couples; prostitutes, single women, and gay men, lesbians, and other sexual minorities. As hundreds of these "vagrants" and their lawyers claimed that vagrancy laws were unconstitutional, the laws became a flashpoint for debates about radically different visions of order and freedom. In Goluboff's compelling portrayal, the legal campaign against vagrancy laws becomes a sweeping legal and social history of the 1960s. Touching on movements advocating civil rights, peace, gay rights, welfare rights, and cultural revolution, <em>Vagrant Nation</em> provides insight relevant to this battle, as well as the battle over the legacy of the 1960s' transformations themselves.<br></p><p><br><strong>Risa Goluboff </strong>is the Dean of the University of Virginia School of Law and the Arnold H. Leon Professor of Law. She is also the author of <em>The Lost Promise of Civil Rights. </em><br><br>"With limpid and stylish prose and an eye for illustrative detail, Goluboff traces how the 'vagrancy law regime' came to be challenged and ultimately eliminated...[T]his compelling history, with its strong narrative flow, ranges widely beyond the chambers of the Supreme Court, offering a social history of legal change...<em>Vagrant Nation</em> is a necessary contribution to the history of police and social movements in the postwar United States..."--Stuart Schrader, <em>The Journal of Southern History</em><p></p><br>"<em>Vagrant Nation</em> is an extraordinary accomplishment, one of the best books of constitutional history ever written. Using vagrancy law as her launching pad, Goluboff ties together and sheds light upon all of the major social reform movements of the 1960s and the constitutional law that arose around them-civil rights, gay rights, criminal procedure rights, the free speech rights of communists and Vietnam War protestors, the expressive rights of hippies and beatniks, and the sexual revolution. In the process, Goluboff teaches us how constitutional law gets made."--Michael J. Klarman, Kirkland &amp; Ellis Professor, Harvard Law School<p></p><br>"<em>Vagrant Nation</em> is a fascinating account of how constitutional change occurs when old laws and new social understandings collide."--Linda Greenhouse, Lecturer, Yale Law School<p></p><br>"<em>Vagrant Nation</em> tells how police used vagrancy laws as all-purpose weapons to stifle the movements defining the Sixties, and how a movement of movements persuaded the Supreme Court to eradicate those laws and ban jailing people simply because they were different--black, poor, gay, hippie, or antiwar. It's a brilliant account of how a forgotten campaign to reform the law made America a more tolerant and much better country."--Lincoln Caplan, Truman Capote Visiting Lecturer in Law, Yale Law School<p></p><br>"A masterful exploration of constitutional change! Goluboff presents a fascinating account of how dragnet criminal laws, once considered desirable protection against undesirables, clashed with emerging visions of a more inclusive society."--Susan Herman, President, American Civil Liberties Union<p></p><br>"Goluboff offers a genuinely original take on the civil rights revolution--and one of enduring relevance in this era of high tension between the police and minorities."--Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science, Yale University <br><p></p><br>"Goluboff delivers an intelligently articulated, well-researched explication of vagrancy laws, including how new interpretations helped transform American society during the 1960s."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Wreck of the Whale Ship Essex: The Complete Illustrated Edition: The Extraordinary and Distressing Memoir That Inspired Herman Melville&#39;s Moby-Dick</h2><p><p><b>Read Owen Chase's memoir which inspired <i>Moby-Dick</i> and <i>In the Heart of the Sea,</i> the major motion picture from Ron Howard,<i></i>released December 2015.</b></p><p>Owen Chase was the first mate on the ill-fated American whaling ship <i>Essex</i>, which was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in the southern Pacific Ocean in 1820.

Banks gives readers a forward-reaching look toward increasing their understanding of what multicultural education means for classroom teaching in contemporary classrooms. Here he explores the concepts, principles, theories, and practices of multicultural education in such key areas as: the goals and misconceptions of multicultural education; citizenship education and diversity in a global age; curriculum transformation; curriculum reform; and, school reform and intergroup education. Included are checklists for evaluating informational materials and evaluating multicultural education. <i>An Introduction to Multicultural Education</i> is ideal for pre-service and practicing educators who require a concrete approach but have little time to devote to the topic.</p></p><p><p>What are the goals of multicultural education? What are the misconceptions? Why is it essential for students to acquire the knowledge skills, and attitudes needed to function as effective citizens in today&#x2019;s diverse society? And, how can today&#x2019;s busy educators decide upon and include sound concepts, principles, theories, and practices of multicultural education effectively into their everyday teaching and administration?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These questions and many more are answered by leading authority James A. Banks as he takes a forward-reaching look toward furthering an understanding of what multicultural education means for classroom teaching today. This succinct, yet comprehensive overview of the ideas and principles of multicultural education is written for readers who can devote only limited time to the topic. In it readers see clearly the many dimensions of multicultural education, the characteristics of schools which embrace multicultural diversity, and the ways in which multicultural education seeks to transform the curriculum. In addition, the text covers the characteristics of effective multicultural lessons and units, the major benchmarks educators can use to determine whether a school or educational institution is implementing multicultural education most effectively, important benchmarks to reform, and much more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b> <i>The new edition features:</i> </b> </p> <ul> <li> A new chapter on knowledge construction and curriculum reform.

Studies of human ecology are integrated into the text, and the links to related disciplines are emphasised. The text begins with the ecology of individual organisms and moves on, through communities and ecosystems, to global considerations of biogeography, co-evolution and conservation. Case histories, historical perspectives, controversial theories and extension material are highlighted throughout the book. The second edition has been brought up to date with current syllabuses by the addition of further material on the key issue of conservation, giving excellent coverage of the principles of conservation and using case studies to provide examples of conservation policies in practice. The authors are experienced teachers of ecology at sixth form and undergraduate level.</p><p>&#39;... a good readable textbook on ecology, which will be very useful to its targeted readership&#39; Tony Browne, The Open University Geological Society</p><h2>The Convenient Marriage</h2><p>When the most eligible Earl of Rule offers for the hand of the Beauty of the Winwood Family, he has no notion of the distress he causes his intended.</p><p>Georgette Heyer, who wrote over fifty novels died in 1974.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>Lady Winwood being denied, the morning caller inquired with some anxiety for Miss Winwood, or, in fact, for any of the young ladies. In face of the rumour which had come to her ears it would be too provoking if all the Winwood ladies were to withhold themselves. But the porter held the door fully open and said that Miss Winwood was at home.</p> <p>Directing the coachman of her extremely smart town carriage to wait for her, Mrs Maulfrey stepped into the dim hall, and said briskly: &#x2018;Where is Miss Winwood? You need not be at the trouble of announcing me.'</p> <p>All the young ladies, it seemed, were in the small saloon. Mrs Maulfrey nodded, and walked across the hall with a click of her high heels. As she ascended the stairs her armazine skirts, spread over very large paniers � coudes, brushed the banisters on either side of her. She reflected, not for the first time, that the stairway was too narrow, and the carpet positively shabby. She would be ashamed for her part of such old-fashioned furnishings; but although she claimed cousinship, she was not, she admitted to herself, a Winwood of Winwood.</p> <p>The small saloon, by which name the porter designated a back sitting-room given over to the use of the young ladies, lay up one pair of stairs, and was well known to Mrs Maulfrey. She tapped with her gloved hand on one of the panels of the door, and entered on the echo of her knock.</p> <p>The three Misses Winwood were grouped by the window, presenting an artless and agreeable picture. Upon a faded yellow satin sopha sat Miss Winwood and Miss Charlotte, their arms entwined about each other's waists. They were much alike, but Miss Winwood was held to be the greater beauty. Her classic profile was turned to the door, but upon Mrs Maulfrey's rustling entrance she looked round and displayed to the visitor a pair of melting blue eyes and a sweet, arched mouth that formed at the moment an O of mild surprise. A quantity of fair curls dressed without powder and threaded by a blue riband framed her face and tumbled on to her shoulders in several ordered locks.</p> <p>Miss Charlotte was not seen to advantage beside the Beauty of the Family, but she was a true Winwood, with the famous straight nose and the same blue eyes. Her curls, not quite so fair as her sister's, owed their existence to hot irons, her eyes were of a shallower blue, and her colouring inclined towards the sallow; but she was allowed to be a very well-looking young lady.</p> <p>Miss Horatia, the youngest of the three, had nothing that declared her lineage except her nose. Her hair was dark, her eyes a profound grey, and her brows, nearly black and rather thick, were quite straight, and gave her a serious, almost frowning, expression. No amount of careful training would induce an arch in them. She was quite half a head shorter than her sisters, and, at the age of seventeen, was obliged regretfully to admit that she was not likely to grow any taller.</p> <p>When Mrs Maulfrey came into the room Horatia was seated on a low stool by the sopha, propping her chin in her hands, and scowling dreadfully. Or perhaps, thought Mrs Maulfrey, that was just a trick of those preposterous eyebrows.</p> <p>All three sisters wore morning toilets of worked muslin over slight hoops, with tiffany sashes round their waists. Countrified, thought Mrs Maulfrey, giving her fringed silk mantle a satisfied twitch.</p> <p>&#x2018;My dears!' she exclaimed. &#x2018;I came the instant I heard! Tell me at once, is it true? Has Rule offered?'</p> <p>Miss Winwood, who had risen gracefully to receive her cousin, seemed to droop and to grow pale. &#x2018;Yes,' she said faintly. &#x2018;Alas, it is quite true, Theresa.'</p> <p>Mrs Maulfrey's eyes grew round with respect. &#x2018;Oh, Lizzie!' she breathed. &#x2018;Rule! A Countess! Twenty thousand a year, I have heard, and I daresay it may be found to be more!'</p> <p>Miss Charlotte set a chair for her, observing with a reproving note in her voice: &#x2018;We believe Lord Rule to be a most eligible gentleman. Though no one,' she added, clasping Miss Winwood's hand tenderly, &#x2018;however genteel, could be worthy of our dearest Lizzie!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Lord, Charlotte!' said Mrs Maulfrey tartly, &#x2018;Rule's the biggest prize in the market, and you know it. It is the most amazing piece of good fortune ever I heard. Though I will say, Lizzie, you deserve it. Yes, you do, and I am quite enchanted for you. Only to think of the Settlements!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I find the thought of Settlements particularly indelicate, Theresa,' said Miss Charlotte. &#x2018;Mama will no doubt arrange with Lord Rule, but Lizzie cannot be supposed to concern herself with such sordid questions as the size of Lord Rule's fortune.'</p> <p>The youngest Miss Winwood, who all the time had continued to sit with her chin in her hands, suddenly raised her head and delivered herself of one shattering word. &#x2018;S-stuff!' she said, in a deep little voice that just quivered on a stammer.</p> <p>Miss Charlotte looked pained; Miss Winwood gave a rather wan smile. &#x2018;Indeed, I fear Horry is in the right,' she said sadly. &#x2018;It is just the Fortune.' She sank on to the sopha again, and gazed fixedly out of the window.</p> <p>Mrs Maulfrey became aware that the steady blue eyes were swimming in tears. &#x2018;Why, Lizzie!' she said. &#x2018;One would think you had had dark tidings instead of a splendid Offer!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Theresa!' intoned Miss Charlotte, putting both arms about her sister. &#x2018;Is this worthy of you? Can it be that you have forgotten Mr Heron?'</p> <p>Mrs Maulfrey had forgotten Mr Heron. Her jaw dropped slightly, but she recovered in a moment. &#x2018;To be sure: Mr Heron,' she said. &#x2018;It is very afflicting, but Rule, you know! I don't say poor Mr Heron is not a very estimable creature, but a mere lieutenant, dearest Lizzie, and I daresay will soon have to go back to that horrid war in America it's not to be thought of, my love!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No,' said Elizabeth in a suffocated voice. &#x2018;Not to be thought of.'</p> <p>Horatia's dark gaze dwelled broodingly on her second sister. &#x2018;I think it would be a very good thing if Charlotte were to have R-Rule,' she pronounced.</p> <p>&#x2018;Horry!' gasped Charlotte.</p> <p>&#x2018;Lord, my dear, what things you say!' remarked Mrs Maulfrey indulgently. &#x2018;It's Elizabeth Rule wants.'</p> <p>Horatia shook her head vehemently. &#x2018;No. Only a Winwood,' she said in the tense way she had. &#x2018;All arranged years ago. I d-don't believe he's set eyes on L-Lizzie upwards of half a d-dozen times. It can't signify.'</p> <p>Miss Charlotte released her sister's hand, and said palpitatingly: &#x2018;Nothing nothing would induce me to marry Lord Rule, even if he had offered for me! The very notion of Matrimony is repugnant to me. I have long made up my mind to be a Prop to Mama.' She drew a breath. &#x2018;If ever any gentleman could induce me to contemplate the Married State, I assure you, my dear Horry, it would be one far other than Lord Rule.'</p> <p>Mrs Maulfrey had no difficulty in interpreting this announcement. &#x2018;For my part, I like a rake,' she observed. &#x2018;And Rule is so extremely handsome!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I think,' said Horatia obstinately, &#x2018;that M-Mama might have suggested Charlotte.'</p> <p>Elizabeth turned her head: &#x2018;You don't understand, Horry dear. Mama could not do such an odd thing.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Does my Aunt force you to it, Lizzie?' inquired Mrs Maulfrey, pleasantly intrigued.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh no, no!' Elizabeth replied earnestly. &#x2018;You know Mama's tenderness. She is all consideration, all sensibility! It is only my own consciousness of my Duty to the Family that leads me to take a step so so disastrous to my happiness.'</p> <p>&#x2018;M-mortgages,' said Horatia cryptically.</p> <p>&#x2018;Pelham, I suppose?' said Mrs Maulfrey.</p> <p>&#x2018;Of course it is Pelham,' replied Charlotte with a touch of bitterness. &#x2018;Everything is his fault. Ruin stares us in the face.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Poor Pelham!' Elizabeth said, with a sigh for her absent brother. &#x2018;I am afraid he is very extravagant.'</p> <p>&#x2018;It's his gambling debts, I take it,' opined Mrs Maulfrey. &#x2018;My Aunt seemed to think that even your Portions...' She left the sentence delicately unfinished.</p> <p>Elizabeth flushed, but Horatia said: &#x2018;You can't blame P-Pel. It's in the blood. One of us must m-marry Rule. Lizzie's the eldest and the p-prettiest, but Charlotte would do very well. Lizzie's promised to Edward Heron.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Not "promised", dearest,' Elizabeth said in a low voice. &#x2018;We only hoped, if he could but get his Captaincy, perhaps Mama would consent.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Even supposing it, my love,' said Mrs Maulfrey with great good sense, &#x2018;what what, I ask of you, is a Captain of a Line Regiment when compared with the Earl of Rule? And from all I hear the young man has the most meagre of fortunes, and who, pray, is to buy his promotion?'</p> <p>Horatia said, quite undaunted: &#x2018;Edward t-told me that if he had the good fortune to be in another engagement there might be a ch-chance.'</p> <p>Miss Winwood gave a slight shudder, and lifted one hand to her cheek. &#x2018;Don't, Horry!' she begged.</p> <p>&#x2018;It doesn't signify,' Mrs Maulfrey declared. &#x2018;I know you will say I am unfeeling, my dear Lizzie, but it would not do at all. Why, how would you contrive on the young man's pay? It is all horribly sad, but only think of the position you will fill, the jewels you will have!'</p> <p>The prospect appeared to affect Miss Winwood with revulsion, but she said nothing. It was left to Horatia to express the sentiments of all three sisters. &#x2018;Vulgar!' she said. &#x2018;You are, you know, Theresa.'</p> <p>Mrs Maulfrey blushed, and made a business of arranging her stiff skirts. &#x2018;Of course I know that would not weigh with Lizzie, but you can't deny it is a brilliant match. What does my Aunt feel?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Deeply thankful,' said Charlotte. &#x2018;As indeed we must all be, when we consider the straits Pelham has placed us in.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Where is Pelham?' demanded Mrs Maulfrey.</p> <p>&#x2018;We are not quite certain,' answered Elizabeth. &#x2018;We think perhaps in Rome now. Poor Pel is but an indifferent correspondent. But I feel sure we shall hear from him quite soon.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, he will have to come home for your wedding, I suppose,' said Mrs Maulfrey. &#x2018;But, Lizzie, you must tell me! Has Rule paid his addresses? I had not the least idea of anything of the kind, though, naturally, I had heard that it was in a way arranged. But he has been so very ' She apparently thought better of what she had been about to say, and broke off. &#x2018;But that's neither here nor there, and I daresay he will be a charming husband. Have you given him your answer, Lizzie?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Not yet,' said Elizabeth almost inaudibly. &#x2018;I I too had no notion of it, Theresa. I have met him, of course. He stood up with me for the first two dances at the subscription-ball at Almack's, when Pelham was at home. He was he has always been all that is amiable, but that he intended offering for my hand I never dreamed. He waited on Mama yesterday only to to solicit her permission to pay his addresses to me. There is nothing announced yet, you must understand.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Everything of the most correct!' approved Mrs Maulfrey. &#x2018;Oh, my love, I cannot help it if you say I have no sensibility, but only conceive of having Rule paying his addresses to one! I declare I would give my eyes or, I would have,' she corrected herself, &#x2018;had I not married Mr Maulfrey. And so,' she added, &#x2018;would every other young lady in town! Why, my dears, you would not believe the caps that have been set at him!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Theresa, I must, I must request you not to talk in that odious way!' said Charlotte.</p> <p>Horatia was looking at her cousin with interest. &#x2018;Why do you say "only c-conceive of Rule paying his addresses to one"? I thought he was quite old.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Old?' said Mrs Maulfrey. &#x2018;Rule? Nothing of the sort, my dear! Not a day above thirty-five, I'll stake my reputation. And what a leg! What an air! The most engaging smile!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I c-call that old,' said Horatia calmly. &#x2018;Edward is only t-twenty-two.'</p> <p>There did not seem to be much to say after that. Mrs Maulfrey, perceiving that she had culled all the news that her cousins could at this present impart, began to think of taking her leave of them. Though sorry for Elizabeth's evident distress at the magnificent prospect ahead of her she could not in the least understand it, and considered that the sooner Lieutenant Heron was posted back to his regiment the better it would be. Therefore, when the door opened to admit a spare female of uncertain age, who informed Elizabeth with a flutter in her voice that Mr Heron was below and begged the favour of a word with her, she pursed her lips, and looked as disapproving as she could.</p> <p>Elizabeth's colour fluctuated, but she rose up from the sopha, and said quietly: &#x2018;Thank you, Laney.' </p> <p>Miss Lane seemed to share a little of Mrs Maulfrey's disapproval. She regarded Elizabeth in a deprecating way, and suggested: &#x2018;My dear Miss Winwood, do you think you should? Do you think your Mama would like it?'</p> <p>Elizabeth replied with her gentle air of dignity: &#x2018;I have Mama's permission, dear Laney, to to tell Mr Heron of the approaching change in my estate. Theresa, you won't I know, speak of Lord Rule's obliging offer until until it is formally announced.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Too noble creature!' Charlotte sighed, as the door closed softly behind Miss Winwood. &#x2018;How very lowering it is to reflect upon the trials that afflict the Female Sex!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Edward is afflicted too,' said Horatia practically. Her penetrating eyes rested on her cousin. &#x2018;Theresa, if you ch-chatter about this you will be sorry. Something must be d-done.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What can be done, when our sweetest Lizzie goes a Willing Sacrifice to the Altar?' said Charlotte in a hollow voice.</p> <p>&#x2018;Trials! Sacrifice!' exclaimed Mrs Maulfrey. &#x2018;Lord, one would think Rule an ogre to listen to you! You put me out of all patience, Charlotte. A house in Grosvenor Square, and Meering, which I am told is quite superb, the park seven miles about, and three lodge-gates!'</p> <p>&#x2018;It will be a great position,' said the little governess in her breathless way. &#x2018;But who should fill it better than dear Miss Winwood? One has always felt that she was destined for a high place.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Pho!' said Horatia scornfully, and snapped her fingers. &#x2018;That for Rule's great p-position!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Miss Horatia, I beg of you, not that ungenteel gesture!'</p> <p>Charlotte came to the support of her sister. &#x2018;You should not snap your fingers, Horry, but you are quite in the right. Lord Rule does very very well for himself in getting a Winwood for his bride.'</p> <p>Meanwhile Miss Winwood, pausing only for a moment on the staircase to calm the agitation which the news of Mr Heron's arrival had induced, went down to the library on the ground floor of the house.</p> <p>Here there awaited her a young man in a state of greater agitation than her own.</p> <p>Mr Edward Heron, of the 10th Foot, at present in America, was stationed in England on Recruiting Service. He had been wounded at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, and sent home shortly afterwards, his wound being of a serious enough nature to preclude his taking further part for a time at least in the hostilities abroad. Upon his recovery gazetted, greatly to his chagrin, for Home Service.</p> <p>The acquaintance between himself and Miss Winwood was of long standing. The younger son of a country gentleman whose estates marched with Viscount Winwood's, he had known the Misses Winwood almost from the hour of his birth. He was of excellent if impoverished family, and had he been the possessor of a rather large fortune might have been deemed an eligible though not brilliant match for Elizabeth.</p> <p>When Miss Winwood entered the library he arose from a seat by the window, and came towards her with an anxious look of inquiry upon his countenance. He was a personable young man, and looked very well in his scarlet regimentals. He had height, and good shoulders, and a frank, open countenance, rather ...</p></p><h2>The Bigs: The Secrets Nobody Tells Students and Young Professionals About How to Find a Great Job, Do a Great Job, Be a Leader, Start a Business, Stay Out of Trouble, and Live A Happy Life</h2><p><p><b>What is <i>The Bigs?</i></b> In baseball, "the bigs" is slang for the big leagues.

A breakthrough book, this will change the way society views girls and women.</p><p>While working on her doctorate at Harvard, Hancock interviewed 20 women about their development as adults. Analyzing the answers of these white, predominantly middle-class women, she concluded that for women the key to maturity often lies in reintegrating the androgynous eight- or nine-year-old "girl within" with the woman she has become. That is, modern women must look back to their early strengths to form their own role models; they can no longer follow the role of traditional mother yet at the same time find it difficult to emulate the available male roles. Hancock's effective presentation of these women's reflections makes a readable and interesting expansion of a doctoral thesis. An extensive bibliography is included.

P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.In their efforts to make their way in careers and the world, many women neglect their inner selves, according to Hancock. In what PW termed "a thoughtful self-help guide that may lead women into a re-examination of their lives," Hancock generalizes from case studies of 20 women, in search of an "authentic" sense of identity. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Culture of Flowers</h2><p>Jack Goody&#39;s new book takes as its theme the symbolic and transactional uses of flowers in secular life and religious ritual from ancient Egypt to modern times. He links the use of flowers to the rise of advanced systems of agriculture, the growth of social stratification, and the spread of luxury goods, looking at the history of aesthetic horticulture in Europe and Asia. Other themes which emerge are the role of written texts in building up a culture of flowers; the importance of trade and communications in disseminating and transforming attitudes to flowers; the rejection on puritanical grounds of flowers and their artistic representation, and the multiplicity of meanings which flowers possess.

She proved so successful that she ascended the Catholic hierarchy in Rome and was eventually elected pope. Her pontificate lasted two years, until she became pregnant and died after giving birth during a public procession from the Vatican.<br> <br> Or so the legend goes&#x2014;a legend that was fabricated sometime in the thirteenth century, according to Alain Boureau, and which has persisted in one form or another down to the present day. In this fascinating saga of belief and rhetoric, politics and religion, Boureau investigates the historical and ecclesiastical circumstances under which the myth of Pope Joan was constructed and the different uses to which it was put over the centuries. He shows, for instance, how Catholic clerics justified the exclusion of women from the papacy and the priesthood by employing the myth in misogynist moral tales, only to find the popess they had created turned against them in anti-Catholic propaganda during the Reformation.</p></p><p><b>Alain Boureau</b> is director of studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, and a director at the Centre de Recherches Historiques, Paris.

He achieved his comeback in large part through the innovative means he used to promote himself and the artists of his inner circle. Stieglitz and a number of well-established critics drew on period conceptions of sexuality, gender, and cultural identity to characterize the artists he championed as the fulfillment of a shared vision of a vital, nonrepressed American art.In Painting Gender, Constructing Theory, Marcia Brennan examines how Stieglitz and the critics drew on early-twentieth-century discourses on sex and the psyche, particularly the theories of Sigmund Freud and Havelock Ellis, to characterize the artworks of the Stieglitz circle. Critics routinely described the often highly abstracted paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, John Marin, Marsden Hartley, and Charles Demuth as transparent displays of the most intimate aspects of the self, taking both subject matter and painterly form to be guided by the artist's own gendered and psychic energies.Focusing on the key historical criticism and artworks, Brennan shows how the identities of all five Stieglitz circle artists were presented in terms of the masculinity and femininity, and the heterosexuality and homosexuality, thought to be embedded in their work. Brennan also discusses Stieglitz's relation to competing artistic and critical movements, including Thomas Hart Benton's regionalist art and Clement Greenberg's reformulation of formalism. Arguing that American formalist criticism consisted of a complex and paradoxical mixture of corporeality and disembodied transcendence, Brennan provides insight not only into the works of the Stieglitz circle but into the development of formalist criticism itself.</p></p><p>Marcia Brennan is Associate Professor of Art History at Rice University. She has previously taught art history at Brown University and the College of the Holy Cross. She is the author of <i>Painting Gender, Constructing Theory: The Alfred Stieglitz Circle and American Formalist Aesthetics</i> (2002) and <i>Modernism's Masculine Subjects: Matisse, the New York School, and Post-Painterly Abstraction</i> (2006), both published by the MIT Press.<p>"Brennan's book clearly contributes to both gender studies and the field of American modernism." Margaret Sundell Bookforum</p><br><br><p>"Painting Gender, Constructing Theory unearths the American underpinnings of that old monolith, formalism, and finds the erotic aesthetic of Alfred Stieglitz.&nbsp; Brennan shows how, through subtle, visual, and epistolary modes of influence, the charismatic photographer left a lasting imprint on the language of 20th-century art criticism. She delivers more than a well crafted thesis; her reader assimilates something of the very resonances between body and intellect, intimacy and spiritualism, that must have excited Steiglitz and his circle."--Susan Elizabeth Ryan, Louisiana State University</p><br><br><p>"Brennan brilliantly demonstrates how Stieglitz's house critics promoted a public image of his artists as revealing a modern eroticized and gendered identity in the abstract forms of their paintings. Her research is groundbreaking, in her reading of this school of criticism as an edifice that was socially constructed and permeated by discourses on sex and the psyche. This book establishes a vivid picture of Stieglitz and his friends as they successfully naturalized their own sexual and artistic ideologies, in the process of interpreting abstract forms as intrinsically shaped by gendered, erotic energies. Brennan's research should become essential reading for scholars of American modernism."--Kathleen A. Pyne, Department of Art, Art History, and Design, University of Notre Dame</p><br><br><p>"Marcia Brennan has convincingly placed Alfred Stieglitz at the very center of a 40-year debate about erotic energy and aesthetic purity in American modernist abstraction. She shows Stieglitz to have brought sex to the fore both in painting by his following of artists and in the extremely gendered discourse about it. She convincingly demonstrates how the photographer's influence extends as far as Clement Greenberg, who had to construct his position by imagining it in opposition to that of Stieglitz."--Jay Bochner, Universit� de Montr�al</p></p><h2>Adobe Premiere Pro: Classroom in a Book</h2><p><p>Move over Final Cut Pro.

They are versatile, useful, and beautiful. They mark boundaries, create barriers, deter animals, frame views, and block eyesores. Shrubs can promote privacy, offer a welcome to guests, or act as a background in a border. As ground covers, they can control erosion or act as an attractive, low-maintenance alternative to lawns. In their all-season versatility, they provide flowers and fragrance, colorful foliage, berries for the birds, and green color in winter. Because shrubs are not throwaway plants, it&#39;s all the more important to buy the right shrub for the right place. Too many gardeners have had the experience of putting in a neat little shrub and watching it grow to be a window-blocking monster. With this expert guide, readers will buy the right shrub in the first place and learn how to keep it looking its best.</p><p>Gordon DeWolf served as Horticulturist at the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University and is a frequent contributor to Horticulture magazine."Taylor's Guides are the best, most authoritative guides on the market."

By its end there had been 275,000 Allied and 200,000 German casualties. Yet the territorial gains made in four desperate months were won back by Germany in only three days the following March.<br>The devastation at Passchendaele, the authors argue, was neither inevitable nor inescapable; nor perhaps was it necessary at all. Using a substantial archive of official private records, much of which has never been previously consulted or exploited for a work of this kind, Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson provide the fullest account of the campaign yet published.<br>The book examines the political dimension at a level which has hitherto been absent from accounts of 'Third Ypres'. It establishes what did occur, the options for alternative action, and the fundamental responsibility for the carnage. Prior and Wilson consider the shifting ambitions and stratagems of the high command, examine the logistics of war, and assess what the available manpower, weaponry, technology and intelligence could realistically have hoped to achieve. Most powerfully of all, they explore the experience of the men on the ground in the light - whether they knew it or not - of what was never going to be accomplished.</p><p>Reviews of the earlier edition: "The clearest and most balanced picture yet of a battle whose very name evokes the horror and supposed futility of [World War I]."&#x2014;John Grigg, The Spectator "This book will appeal to both the scholar and the general public and belongs in every World War I collection."&#x2014;Agnes F. Peterson, History "The most wide-ranging and perceptive account of Passchendaele yet written."&#x2014;Robert Cowley, Military History Quarterly "The authors excel in their thorough use of original sources to provide a masterly account . . . clearly related and supported by admirable maps."&#x2014;Brian Bond, Times Literary Supplement "Lucid and persuasive."&#x2014;E. S. Turner, London Review of Books "[An] extraordinary investigation of Sir Douglas Haig's ruinous Ypres campaign of 1917. . . . This is the most wide-ranging and perceptive account of Passchendaele yet written. [This] book not only captures the agony of the soldiers' war but, in the measured, understated tone of the best prosecutors, leads us to inevitable conclusions."&#x2014;Robert Cowley, Military History Quarterly "A monument to scholarship, economical and often eloquent writing, and a solid grasp of the real issues involved in World War I. . . . This is a great book. . . . It is a book that every marine who aspires to higher command should add to his or her library&#x2014;one that will undoubtedly reward its owner by rereading and rereading."&#x2014;Williamson Murray, Marine Corps Gazette "Without a doubt the best book on the campaign yet published. . . . It is well-researches, well-written, and will keep historians arguing for years to come."&#x2014;Stand To "Prior and Wilson, both distinguished historians, have conducted extensive primary research to provide an account at once both provocative and authoritative."&#x2014;Choice "The authors should be commended for writing a balanced, convincing work that reveals the devastation of the First World War and the failure of military and political leaders to recognize this horror."&#x2014;Virginia Quarterly ReviewRobin Prior is Senior Lecturer in History at the Australian Defence Force Academy, the University of New South Wales.</p><h2>Becoming a Manager: Mastery of a New Identity</h2><p>The transition from star performer to a competent manager can be trying for many--even traumatic. The skills that led to success as a salesperson, for example, are very different from those needed to manage a sales force. New managers must learn how to lead others, to win trust and respect, to motivate, and to strike the right balance between delegation and control. It is a transition many new managers fail to make.<br>In BECOMING A MANAGER, Linda Hill traces the experiences of 19 new managers over the course of their first year in a managerial capacity. Through personal interviews she reveals the complexity of the process and examines the expectations of the managers, their subordinates, and their superiors. In their own words the managers describe how they reframed their understanding of their roles and responsibilities, how they learned to build effective work relationships with subordinates, how and when they used individual and organizational resources, and how they learned to cope with the stresses and emotions of the transformation. Above all, they describe what it meant to take on a new identity.<br>Two themes emerge from this fascinating book. First, the transition from individual contributor to manager represented a profound psychological adjustment--a transformation--as the managers tried to contend with their new responsibilities. Second, the process of becoming a manager is primarily one of learning from experience. Through trial and error, observation and interpretation, the new managers learned what it took to become an effective business leader.<br>The human and financial costs associated with the transition to manager can be considerable. Descriptions of bad judgment, burnout, and incompetence abound in these pages. But there are steps companies can take to improve the odds for first-time managers. Linda Hill gives concrete, practical suggestions that any company can use to help managers survive their first year and become effective contributors to the organization.<br>BECOMING A MANAGER provides valuable insight into the challenges that new managers face. It is must reading for human resource professionals and others responsible for management development, as well as for the manager struggling to make the difficult transition to a new identity.</p><p>Linda A. Hill is the Wallace Brett Donham Professor of Business Administration and faculty chair of the Leadership Initiative at Harvard Business School.Hill vividly documents the experiences of 19 first-year managers. Initially, these managers focused on formal authority and setting business performance agendas while ignoring the responsibilities of accomplishing things through others and network building. "They were genuinely surprised, though, by the discontinuity between the producer and manager roles and between their expectations and the realities of management." Hill clearly explains the interpersonal problems of dealing with employee diversity and evaluating the performance of others along with the stressful and emotional side of making the transformation to management. She also addresses how new managers can learn from their experiences and the implications for those responsible for management development. Unlike Joseph and Susan Berk's Managing Effectively ( LJ 6/1/91), which examines what first-time managers should know, Hill discusses the actual transformation of individual performers into effective new managers.

With an emphasis on component and circuit operation, analysis, applications, and testing, this book thoroughly explores the foundation of dc circuits, ac circuits, discrete electronic devices and op-amps in a narrative that readers can understand. Revamped with a new four-color illustration and photo design, the Second Edition offers updated chapter opening vignettes, new margin notes, and component testing and applications discussions. <b> </b> For professionals with a career in electronics or electrical engineering.</p><p><p> The fundamentals of electronics (dc circuits, ac circuits, and devices) have traditionally been taught over the course of four semesters, trimesters, or quarters. With the constant development of new applications courses, however, many educators have expressed a need for a single text that presents these fundamentals in a more condensed format, allowing them to be covered in a shorter period of time. <i>Electronics Technology Fundamentals</i> was written to fulfill this need. The first 8 chapters cover do circuit fundamentals, the second 8 chapters cover ac circuit fundamentals, and the final 10 chapters cover discrete devices and circuits, op-amps, and op-amp circuits. </p> <p> Those who have taught the fundamentals of circuits and devices may wonder how do circuits, ac circuits, and devices can be adequately introduced in a single volume. If you compare this text to the more "traditional" books, you'll see that we have included all the information your students need to continue with more advanced courses. At the same time, we have eliminated the equation derivations and redundant examples that take up so much space in traditional books. (Both, however, are available in supplements for those who wish to use them.) We also forego many sections on circuit applications and troubleshooting for several reasons: First, we discovered (through contact with a variety of instructors) that troubleshooting sections generally are reserved for assigned reading (to save precious class time). In addition, this book was designed to allow more time for future applications courses, so we felt that including the common applications for every principle was unnecessary. What remains is a text that is complete and concise. </p> <p><b>Learning Aids</b></p> <p> As always, our primary goal has been to produce an introductory book that students can really use in their studies. To this end, the most useful learning aids from Paynter's <i>Introductory Electric Circuits and Introductory Electronic Devices and Circuits</i> have been incorporated into this text: </p> <ul> <li><b>Performance-based objectives</b> provide a handy overview of the chapter organization and a map to student learning.</li> <li><b>Objective identifiers</b> in the margins cross-reference the objectives with the chapter material. This helps students to locate the material needed to fulfill a given objective.</li> <li><b>Margin notes</b> highlight the differences between theory and practice and provide brief reminders of principles covered in earlier sections and chapters.</li> <li><b>In-chapter practice problems</b> included in the examples provide students with an immediate opportunity to apply the principles and procedures being demonstrated.</li> <li><b>Summary illustrations</b> provide a convenient description of circuit operating principles and applications. Many also provide comparisons between related circuits.</li> </ul> <p> The following have also been incorporated into Electronics Technology Fundamentals to help reinforce student learning: </p> <ul> <li>Section Review Questions. Each section of the text ends with a series of questions that students can use to check their learning.</li> <li><b>Critical Thinking Questions.</b> Most section reviews include critical thinking questions designed to encourage students to think beyond the scope of the topic discussions.</li> <li><b>Practice Problems.</b> An extensive set of practice problems appears at the end of each chapter. In addition to standard practice problems, most of the problem sets include problems relating to previous chapters <b>(Looking Back)</b> and challengers <b>(Pushing the Envelope)</b></li> </ul> <p><b>Multisim Applications Problems</b></p> <p> Multisim has been incorporated in a manner that allows instructors to choose (on an individual basis) whether to include it in their curriculum. The CD-ROM included with the text contains exercises that were developed and written by <b>George Shaiffer</b> (Pike's Peak Community College, Colorado Springs, CO). </p> <p> Various figures throughout the text are marked with a Multisim icon.

If you have, then take a moment to read on. </p> <p> Any subject is easier to learn if you understand why it is being taught and how it relates to your long-term goals. For this reason, we're going to take a moment to discuss a few things: </p> <ul> <li>How the material in this book relates to a career in electronics technology</li> <li>How you can get the most out of this course</li> </ul> <p> Few developments have affected out lives during the past 30 years as profoundly as those in electronics technology. Most of the electronic "gizmos" we take for granted, such as cellular phones, laptop computers, home theaters, pagers, and personal audio systems, have been developed during this time. These items, and many others, have been made possible by advances in production technology. As a result of these advances, many electronic systems that once filled an entire room can now be held in the palm of your hand. Even so, these systems are extremely complex devices that contain a wide variety of components, and each of these components operates according to one or more fundamental principles. These components and their operating principles are the subjects of this book. </p> <p> Learning how to work on various electronic systems begins with learning the components and principles that are common to all of them. These principles may not always have a direct bearing on <i>how</i> to repair a specific electronic system, but they must be learned if you are to understand <i>why</i> things work the way they do. Learning why things work allows you to grow beyond the scope of any book (or course). </p> <p> The material in this book forms a foundation for the courses that are to follow. This means that learning this material is critical if your knowledge is to advance beyond the point where it is now. </p> <p><b>How Can I Get the Most from This Course?</b></p> <p> There are several steps you can take to ensure that you will successfully complete this course and advance to the next. The first is to accept the fact that <i>learning electronics requires active participation on your part.</i> If you are going to learn the material in this book, you must take an active role in your education. It's like learning to play a musical instrument. You need to practice on a regular basis. You can't learn how to play simply by "reading the book." The same can be said about learning electronics. You must be actively involved in the learning process. </p> <p> How do you get involved in the learning process? Here are some habits that will take you a long way toward successfully completing your course of study: </p> <ul> <li><i>Attend class on a regular basis.</i></li> <li><i>Take part in classroom problem-solving sessions.</i> This means getting out your calculator and solving problems along with the rest of the class.</li> <li><i>Do all the assigned homework.</i> Circuit analysis is a skill. As with any skill, you gain competency only through practice.</li> <li><i>Take part in classroom discussions.</i> More often that not, classroom discussions can clarify points that may be confusing otherwise.</li> <li><i>Read the material before it is discussed in class.</i> When you know what is going to be discussed in class, read the related material <i>before</i> the discussion. That way, you'll know which parts (if any) are causing you problems before the class begins.</li> <li><i>Become an active reader.</i></li> </ul> <p> Being an <i>active reader</i> means that you must do more than simply "read the book." When you are studying new material, there are several things that you should do: </p> <ol> <li><i>Learn the terminology.</i> You are taught new terms because you need to know what they mean and both how and when to use them. When you come across a new term, take time to commit that term to memory. How do you know when a new term is being introduced? Throughout this text, new terms are identified using <b>bold</b> text. When you see a new term, stop and check its meaning before going on to the next section. (If you are unsure of its meaning, look it up in the glossary.)</li> <li><i>Use your calculator to work through the examples.</i> When you come across an example, get out your calculator, and try the example for yourself. When you do this, you develop the skill necessary to solve problems on your own.</li> <li><i>Solve the example practice problems.</i> Most examples in this book end with a practice problem that is identical in nature to the example. When you see these problems, solve them. Then, you can check your answer(s) by looking them up at the end of the chapter.</li> <li><i>Use the chapter objectives to measure your learning.</i> Each chapter begins with an extensive list of performance-based objectives. These objectives tell you what you should be able to do as a result of learning the material.</li> </ol> <p> Throughout this text, <i>objective identifiers</i> are included in the margins. For example, if you look on page 47, you'll see "Objective 4" printed in the margin. This identifier tells you that this is the point where you are taught the skill mentioned in Objective 4 at the opening page of the chapter (page 41). These identifiers can be used to help you with your studies. If you don't know how to perform the action called for in a specific objective, just flip through the chapter until you see the appropriate identifier. At that point, you'll find the information you need to successfully meet the objective. </p> <p><b> One Final Note</b></p> <p> Being an active learner involves a lot of work. However, the extra effort will pay off in the end. Your understanding of electronics will be better as a result of your efforts. We wish you the best of success. </p> <p> <i>Bob Paynter</i><br> Toby Boydell </p><p> With the constant development of new applications and technologies, many educators have expressed a need for a single text that presents the fundamentals of electronics (dc circuits, ac circuits, and devices). <i>Electronics Technology Fundamentals</i> was written to fulfill this need. The first eight chapters cover do circuit fundamentals, the second eight chapters cover ac fundamentals, and the final ten chapters discuss discrete devices and circuits, op-amps, and op-amp circuits. Many basic electronics textbooks provide in-depth coverage of do and ac circuits, but little more than introductory-level coverage of electronic devices and circuits. Unlike these books, <i>Electronics Technology Fundamentals</i> explores electronic devices and circuits as thoroughly as it does do and ac circuits, making it the most comprehensive electronics fundamentals textbook on the market. </p> <p> If you compare the second edition of <i>Electronics Technology Fundamentals</i> with its predecessor, you'll immediately see significant improvements in style and appearance. <i>Enhanced four-color illustrations, updated photos,</i> and <i>improved page design</i> combine with subtle changes in wording to make it easier to study and comprehend the material being presented. Users of the first edition will also notice significant additions to the text. Among these additions: </p> <ul> <li>Chapter opening vignettes help the reader to connect the chapter material to "real-world" circuits and applications, or provide historical background.</li> <li>New sections introduce the reader to component testing and fault symptoms.</li> <li>New margin notes</li> <ul> <li>Introduce applications of principles and circuits.</li> <li>Demonstrate calculator key sequences for many of the problem-solving examples.</li> </ul> <li>Many newer components and component packages are introduced at various points in the text.</li> </ul> <p><b>Learning Aids</b></p> <p> As always, our goal has been to produce a fundamentals book that students can really use in their studies. To this end, we have retained these effective learning ails from the first edition: </p> <ul> <li><b>Performance-based objectives</b> provide a handy overview of the chapter organization and a map to student learning.</li> <li><b>Objective identifiers</b> in the margins cross-reference the objectives with the material contained in the chapter. This helps students to locate the material needed to fulfill a given objective.</li> <li><b>In-chapter practice problems</b> included in most examples provide students with an immediate opportunity to apply the principles and procedures being demonstrated.</li> <li><b>Summary illustrations</b> provide a convenient description of circuit operating principles and applications. Many also provide comparisons between related circuits.</li> <li><b>Margin notes</b> throughout the text:</li> <ul> <li>Highlight differences between theory and practice.</li> <li>Provide reminders of principles covered in earlier sections or chapters.</li> </ul> <li><b>Section review questions.</b> Each section of the text ends with a series of review questions that provide students with the opportunity to gauge their learning processes.</li> <li><b>Critical thinking questions.</b> These questions, incorporated into many of the section reviews, challenge the students to think beyond the scope of the discussions.</li> <li><b>Practice Problems.</b> An extensive set of practice problems appears at the end of each chapter. In addition to standard practice problems, most sets include problems relating to previous chapters (<b>Looking Back</b>) as well as challenges (<b>Pushing the Envelope</b>). </li> </ul> <p><b>Muttisim� Applications</b></p> <p> Multisim� is a schematic capture, simulation, and programmable logic tool used by college and university students in their course of study of Electronics and Electrical Engineering. The circuits on the CD in this text were created for use with Multisim software. </p> <p> Multisim is widely regarded as an excellent tool for classroom and laboratory learning. However, no part of this textbook is dependent upon the Multisim software or the files provided with this text. These files are provided at no extra cost to the consumer and are for use by anyone who chooses to utilize Multisim software. </p> <p> As in the first edition of <i>Electronics Technology Fundamentals,</i> Multisim has been incorporated in a manner that allows instructors to choose (on an individual basis) whether or not to include the software in their curriculum. The CD-ROM included with the text contains over 160 Multisim applications files that have been greatly improved over previous versions. </p> <p> The Multisim files packaged with this edition of the text provide greater dialogue with the reader. A circuit description box provided in each file directs the reader to measure specific values, make changes to each circuit, and observe how the circuit responds to these changes. Each simulation is like a small interactive lesson. The student becomes an active participant, greatly enhancing the learning experience. </p> <p> The first 25% of the circuits on the CD included with this text are already rendered "live" for you by Electronics Workbench in the Textbook Edition of Multisim 7, enabling you to do the following: </p> <ul> <li>Manipulate the interactive components and adjust the value of any virtual components.</li> <li>Run interactive simulation on the active circuits and use any pre-placed virtual instruments.</li> <li>Run analyses.</li> <li>Run/print/save simulation results for the pre-defined viewable circuits.</li> <li>Create your own circuits up to a maximum of 15 components.</li> </ul> <p> The balance of the circuits requires that you have access to Multisim 7 in your school lab (the Lab Edition) or on your computer (Electronics Workbench Student Suite).

If you have, then take a moment to read on. </p> <p> Any subject is easier to learn if you understand <i>why</i> it is being taught and how it relates to your long-term goals. For this reason, we're going to take a moment to discuss a few things: </p> <ul> <li>How the material in this book relates to a career in electronics technology</li> <li>How you can get the most out of this course</li> </ul> <p> Few developments have affected our lives during the past 30 years as profoundly as those in electronics technology.

This text assumes that the students are at least sophomores, so that they are familiar with basic chemical bonding and the periodic table. But it is an introductory materials course, so there will be no differential equations, percolation theory, quantum mechanics, statistical thermodynamics, or other advanced topics. The book is designed as an introduction to the field, not a comprehensive guide to all materials science knowledge. Instead of going into great detail in many areas, the book provides key concepts and fundamentals students need to understand materials science and make informed decisions. An example of the philosophy is found in the materials testing section. Although countless variations exist in testing techniques, the chapter focuses on operating principles and the property to be measured, rather than confusing the student with exposition on variations and exceptions. That material is beyond the scope of most introductory courses.</p><p><b>Dr. James A. Newell</b> is a professor of engineering at Rowan University.

The first American novel to provide a devastatingly accurate portrait of New York's aristocracy, it is the story of the beautiful and beguiling Lily Bart and her ill-fated attempt to rise to the heights of a heartless society in which, ultimately, she has no part. <br> From the staid conventionality of Old New York to the forced conviviality of the French Riviera, from the drawing room of Gus Trenor's Bellomont to the dreary resort of a downtown boardinghouse, Wharton created her "first full-scale survey," as her biographer R.W.B. Lewis put it, "of the <i>com�die humaine,</i> American style." A brilliantly satiric yet sensitive exploration of manners and morality, <i>The House of Mirth</i> marked Wharton's transformation from an amateur into a professional writer on par with her contemporary and friend Henry James. It figures among her most important works.</p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>SAT Premier 2017 with 5 Practice Tests: Online + Book (Kaplan Test Prep)</h2><p>Always study with the most up-to-date prep!

This feeling penetrates the superficial aspect of things and in so doing touches their secrets.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;<b>Rudolf Steiner</b></p><p>How can we progress from the ordinary, everyday vision of the senses to perception of the subtle life and spiritual forces around us&#x2015;the very forces that shape nature?</p><p>Basing his work on the research of Goethe and Rudolf Steiner, Roger Druitt begins with a fundamental question: What can you see? He presents a series of practical exercises for observing nature that, through diligent practice, allow the maturation of subtle capacities of perception. Considering multiple species of leaves, for example, leads to the concept of &#x201c;leaf&#x201d; itself. After this basic groundwork is established, we can take steps toward comprehension of further aspects, such as metamorphosis, gesture, and type.&nbsp;</p><p>Druitt demonstrates how this method&#x2015;what he calls &#x201c;anthroposophicalphenomenology&#x201d;&#x2015;can be applied to other fields of nature observation, opening the way for its use in all areas of life. In each case, whether working with bees, rocks, stars, or color, he shows how we can access the &#x201c;individuality&#x201d; manifested in what is studied. Through a thorough step-by-step process&nbsp;weare led to the ultimate task&#x2015;redeeming the beings of nature and of the Earth itself.</p></p><p><p><b>Roger Druitt&nbsp;</b>was surrounded by nature as a boy, growing up on a farm.

Here are illuminations that bring the words of the Bible alive for a contemporary audience. Some of the world's top calligraphers, working in a tradition all but replaced by the printing press centuries ago, invite us into a rich and varied creation. This second volume of <i>The Art of The Saint John's Bible: A Reader's Guide</i> takes up two great collections of biblical literature '<i>Wisdom Books </i>and<i> Prophets.</i></p><p>The illuminations in <i>Wisdom Books</i> and <i>Prophets</i> draw on motifs from earlier illuminations and expand the visual vocabulary to strike at what is unique and important to these books. In <i>Wisdom Books</i> we find a number of well-known and beloved aphorisms, or words of wisdom." Here calligraphic text treatments take center stage. However, these books also portray the divine in the female figure of Wisdom, presented visually in several large-scale illuminations. The prophets ' messages are often dark and strange, reflecting the grief of exile but also hope. The illuminations throughout these pages reflect Visions of man's inhumanity, but they also burst with the rainbows of God's promise and glory.

He founded what he called the science of human society or social organization, as well as a new methodology for writing history and a new purpose for it, namely to understand the causes of events. While his ideas had little impact on the development of Muslim thought for several centuries, they hugely impressed European thinkers from the nineteenth century on--some of them proclaimed Ibn Khaldun a progenitor of sociology and modern historiography.<br> <br>This book introduces the reader to Ibn Khaldun's core ideas, focusing on his theory of the rise and decline of states. It presents the story of Ibn Khaldun's life, his political ups and downs, and some features of his character that contribute to an understanding of the development of his ideas. The central concept of 'asabiyya (group solidarity) and the factors that lead to its dilution are explained in detail, as also the method of testing (historical) reports for their plausibility. Alatas provides an extended discussion of Ibn Khaldun's views on education and knowledge, and on society. He recounts the reception of Ibn Khaldun in his own time and in the modern period, in the Islamic world and in the West: the range of responses include those who thought Ibn Khaldun merely reworked ideas found in the works of al-Farabi and in the Ikhwan al-Safa' to those who compare him to the giants of Western political and sociological thought, from Machiavelli to Marx. The book also includes a comprehensive list of the various editions and translations of Ibn Khaldun's works into European and non-European languages and also an annotated list of major works in Arabic, English, and other Western languages, which would aid the reader in further research.<br></p><p><br><strong>Syed Farid Alatas</strong> teaches sociology at the National University of Singapore and is also head of its Department of Malay Studies.

Indeed, there are some very good books written about the Linux kernel, Linux system administration, and so on. You will find references right here in this book to many of the ones that I consider to be at the top of their categories.</p> <p>Much of the material presented in this book is motivated by questions I've received over the years from development engineers, in my capacity as an embedded Linux consultant and my present role as a Field Application Engineer for Monta Vista Software, the leading vendor of embedded Linux distributions.</p> <p>Embedded Linux presents the experienced software engineer with several unique challenges. First, those with many years of experience with legacy real-time operating systems (RTOSes) find it difficult to transition their thinking from those environments to Linux. Second, experienced application developers often have difficulty understanding the relative complexities of a cross-development environment.</p> <p>Although this is a primer, intended for developers new to embedded Linux, I am confident that even developers who are experienced in embedded Linux will find some useful tips and techniques that I have learned over the years.</p> <p><b>Practical Advice for the Practicing Embedded Developer</b></p> <p>This book contains my view of what an embedded engineer needs to know to get up to speed fast in an embedded Linux environment. Instead of focusing on Linux kernel internals, the kernel chapter in this book focuses on the project nature of the kernel and leaves the internals to the other excellent texts on the subject. You will learn the organization and layout of the kernel source tree. You will discover the binary components that make up a kernel image, and how they are loaded and what purpose they serve on an embedded system. One of my favorite figures in the book is Figure 5-1, which schematically illustrates the build process of a composite kernel image.</p> <p>In the pages of this book, you will learn how the build system works and how to incorporate into the Linux kernel your own custom changes that are required for your own projects. You will discover the mechanism used to drive the configuration of different architectures and features within the Linux kernel source tree and, more important, how to modify this system to customize it to your own requirements. We also cover in detail the kernel command-line mechanism. You will learn how it works, how to configure the kernel's runtime behavior for your requirements, and how to extend this functionality to your own project. You will learn how to navigate the kernel source code and how to configure the kernel for specific tasks related to an embedded system. You will learn many useful tips and tricks for your embedded project, from bootloaders, system initialization, file systems, and Flash memory to advanced kernel- and application-debugging techniques. </p> <p><b>Intended Audience</b></p> <p>This book is intended for programmers with a working knowledge of programming in C. I assume that you have a rudimentary understanding of local area networks and the Internet. You should understand and recognize an IP address and how it is used on a simple local area network. I also assume that you have an understanding of hexadecimal and octal numbering systems, and their common usage in a text such as this.</p> <p>Several advanced concepts related to C compiling and linking are explored, so you will benefit from having at least a cursory understanding of the role of the linker in ordinary C programming. Knowledge of the GNU make operation and semantics will also prove beneficial.</p> <p><b>What This Book Is Not</b></p> <p>This book is not a detailed hardware tutorial. One of the difficulties the embedded developer faces is the huge variety of hardware devices in use today. The user manual for a modern 32-bit processor with some integrated peripherals can easily exceed 1,000 pages. There are no shortcuts. If you need to understand a hardware device from a programmer's point of view, you will need to spend plenty of hours in your favorite reading chair with hardware data sheets and reference guides, and many more hours writing and testing code for these hardware devices!</p> <p>This is also not a book about the Linux kernel or kernel internals. In this book, you won't learn about the intricacies of the Memory Management Unit (MMU) used to implement Linux's virtual memory-management policies and procedures; there are already several good books on this subject. You are encouraged to take advantage of the "Suggestions for Additional Reading" section found at the end of every chapter.</p> <p><b>Conventions Used</b></p> <p>Filenames and code statements are presented in Courier. Commands issued by the reader are indicated in <b>bold Courier</b>. New terms or important concepts are presented in <i>italics</i>.</p> <p>When you see a pathname preceded with three dots, this references a well-known but unspecified top-level directory. The top-level directory is context dependent but almost universally refers to a top-level Linux source directory. For example, .../arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c refers to the setup.c file located in the architecture branch of a Linux source tree. The actual path might be something like ~/sandbox/linux.2.6.14/arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c.</p> <p><b>Organization of the Book</b></p> <p>Chapter 1, "Introduction," provides a brief look at the factors driving the rapid adoption of Linux in the embedded environment. Several important standards and organizations relevant to embedded Linux are introduced.</p> <p>Chapter 2, "Your First Embedded Experience," introduces the reader to many concepts related to embedded Linux upon which we build in later chapters.</p> <p>In Chapter 3, "Processor Basics," we present a high-level look at the more popular processors and platforms that are being used to build embedded Linux systems. We examine selected products from many of the major processor manufacturers. All of the major architecture families are represented.</p> <p>Chapter 4, "The Linux Kernel&#x2014;A Different Perspective," examines the Linux kernel from a slightly different perspective. Instead of kernel theory or internals, we look at its structure, layout, and build construction so you can begin to learn your way around this large software project and, more important, learn where your own customization efforts must be focused. This includes detailed coverage of the kernel build system.</p> <p>Chapter 5, "Kernel Initialization," details the Linux kernel's initialization process. You will learn how the architecture- and bootloader-specific image components are concatenated to the image of the kernel proper for downloading to Flash and booting by an embedded bootloader. The knowledge gained here will help you customize the Linux kernel to your own embedded application requirements.</p> <p>Chapter 6, "System Initialization," continues the detailed examination of the initialization process. When the Linux kernel has completed its own initialization, application programs continue the initialization process in a predetermined manner. Upon completing Chapter 6, you will have the necessary knowledge to customize your own userland application startup sequence.</p> <p>Chapter 7, "Bootloaders," is dedicated to the booloader and its role in an embedded Linux system. We examine the popular open-source bootloader U-Boot and present a porting example. We briefly introduce additional bootloaders in use today so you can make an informed choice about your particular requirements.</p> <p>Chapter 8, "Device Driver Basics," introduces the Linux device driver model and provides enough background to launch into one of the great texts on device drivers, listed as "Suggestions for Additional Reading" at the end of the chapter.</p> <p>Chapter 9, "File Systems," presents the more popular file systems being used in embedded systems today. We include coverage of the JFFS2, an important embedded file system used on Flash memory devices. This chapter includes a brief introduction on building your own file system image, one of the more difficult tasks the embedded Linux developer faces.</p> <p>Chapter 10, "MTD Subsystem," explores the Memory Technology Devices (MTD) subsystem. MTD is an extremely useful abstraction layer between the Linux file system and hardware memory devices, primarily Flash memory.</p> <p>Chapter 11, "BusyBox," introduces BusyBox, one of the most useful utilities for building small embedded systems. We describe how to configure and build BusyBox for your particular requirements, along with detailed coverage of system initialization unique to a BusyBox environment. Appendix C, "BusyBox Commands," lists the available BusyBox commands from a recent BusyBox release.</p> <p>Chapter 12, "Embedded Development Environment," takes a detailed look at the unique requirements of a typical cross-development environment. Several techniques are presented to enhance your productivity as an embedded developer, including the powerful NFS root mount development configuration.</p> <p>Chapter 13, "Development Tools," examines many useful development tools. Debugging with gdb is introduced, including coverage of core dump analysis. Many more tools are presented and explained, with examples including strace, ltrace, top, and ps, and the memory profilers mtrace and dmalloc. The chapter concludes with an introduction to the more important binary utilities, including the powerful readelf utility.</p> <p>Chapter 14, "Kernel Debugging Techniques," provides a detailed examination of many debugging techniques useful for debugging inside the Linux kernel. We introduce the use of the kernel debugger KGDB, and present many useful debugging techniques using the combination of gdb and KGDB as debugging tools. Included is an introduction to using hardware JTAG debuggers and some tips for analyzing failures when the kernel won't boot.</p> <p>Chapter 15, "Debugging Embedded Linux Applications," moves the debugging context from the kernel to your application programs. We continue to build on the gdb examples from the previous two chapters, and we present techniques for multithreaded and multiprocess debugging.</p> <p>Chapter 16, "Porting Linux," introduces the issues related to porting Linux to your custom board. We walk through a simple example and highlight the steps taken to produce a working Linux kernel on a custom PowerPC board. Several important concepts are presented that have trapped many newcomers to Linux kernel porting. Together with the techniques presented in Chapters 13 and 14, you should be ready to tackle your own custom board port after reading this chapter.</p> <p>Chapter 17, "Linux and Real Time," provides an introduction to one of the more exciting developments in embedded Linux: configuring for real time via the CONFIG_RT option. We cover the features available with RT and how they can be used in a design. We also present techniques for measuring latency in your application configuration.</p> <p>The appendixes cover the GNU Public License, U-Boot Configurable Commands, BusyBox Commands, SDRAM Interface Considerations, resources for the open source developer, and a sample configuration file for one of the more popular hardware JTAG debuggers, the BDI-2000.</p> <p><b>Follow Along</b></p> <p>You will benefit most from this book if you can divide your time between the pages of this book and your favorite Linux workstation. Grab an old x86 computer to experiment on an embedded system. Even better, if you have access to a single-board computer based on another architecture, use that. You will benefit from learning the layout and organization of a very large code base (the Linux kernel), and you will gain significant knowledge and experience as you poke around the kernel and learn by doing.</p> <p>Look at the code and try to understand the examples produced in this book. Experiment with different settings, configuration options, and hardware devices. Much can be gained in terms of knowledge, and besides, it's loads of fun!</p> <p><b>GPL Copyright Notice</b></p> <p>Portions of open-source code reproduced in this book are copyrighted by a large number of individual and corporate contributors.

Now, in <i>The Mystery of Love,</i> the profound philosopher and beloved spiritual teacher invites readers to the next step on the journey, addressing with passion, wisdom, and genuine humility the all-important issues of love, creativity, and our erotic connection to the universe.&nbsp;<br>In the tradition of M. Scott Peck's <i>The Road Less Traveled</i> and Gary Zukov's <i>The Seat of the Soul</i>, <i>The Mystery of Love</i> speaks penetratingly to the age-old desire to move beyond emptiness and alienation and touch the full Eros of living. Gafni, with clarity, brilliance, and great compassion, re-frames our understandings of the erotic and the sensual in a way that invites us to live with passion and love in all facets of our lives. While drawn from the ancient wisdom texts of the Kabbalist tradition, <i>The Mystery of Love </i>speaks to all readers who seek a passionate, joyful, yet deeply grounded exploration of the ancient mysteries as their guide to enlightenment.&nbsp;<br>"The ancient wisdom of the great Hebrew mystics makes one essential promise: There is a better way to live," says Gafni. Widely revered for his profound insight, genuine love, and life-enriching advice and guidance, Gafni delivers here his most nourishing message yet, empowering countless millions of contemporary souls to finally bridge the crucial chasm that separates alienation and boredom from love and passion.</p><p>Author Marc Gafni always intuitively felt that the erotic must have a powerful link to the sacred, but not until he committed himself to the study of Hebrew mysticism was he able to articulate this link. According to Gafni, most people assume that eros is just another word for sex. "The fact that we so often confuse eros with sex merely reminds us of how distant we are from true erotic engagement," he writes. And herein lies Gafni's mission for this book.<p>"Eros is to be fully present to what is," he declares. "It is to open your eyes and see for the first time the full beauty and gorgeousness of a friend, to smell the richness of an aroma, to feel the fullness of throbbing desire, and to taste the erotic experience that connects you with every being. It is to feel the palpable love that dissolves the walls of ego, anger, and anxiety."</p><p>Drawing from the ancient texts of the Kabbalist tradition, Gafni unravels the wondrous relationships among sex, eros, love, and the sacred. He calls this discussion "Hebrew tantra," yet readers of all denominations will find this an inspiring book on sacred sexuality. As in his previous book <i>Soul Prints</i>, Gafni remains eloquent and intelligent while also offering accessible insights. Don't expect advice on sexual positions or eye-gazing foreplay. Rather, he uses brief essays, ancient teachings, and heartfelt wisdom to help us nurture our erotic potential even as we face our aging bodies and shadowy desires. At its core, this is a worthwhile book about living with great love and great spirit, written by an author who obviously does both. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Dr. Marc Gafni is a visionary thinker, social activist, passionate philosopher, wisdom teacher, and author of ten books, including the award-winning <i>Your Unique Self: The Radical Path to Personal Enlightenment</i>, the two-volume <i>Radical Kabbalah</i>, and the recently published <i>Self in Integral Evolutionary Mysticism: Two Models and Why They Matter</i>. He holds his doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University, rabbinic certification from the chief rabbinate in Israel, as well private rabbinic ordination.&nbsp;<br>Dr. Gafni teaches on the cutting edge of philosophy in the West, helping to evolve a new 'dharma,' or meta-theory of Integral meaning that is helping to re-shape key pivoting points in consciousness and culture. He is a guest editor of the Journal of Integral Theory and Practice on issues of integral spirituality, and has been a faculty member of JFK University. He is the co-founder, together with Ken Wilber, of The Center for Integral Wisdom, a leading activist think tank dedicated to articulating a practical politics of love, and to catalyzing an emergent personal and global vision of ethics, eros and meaning.&nbsp;<br>Known for his rare combination of brilliant mind and overflowing heart, Gafni is a leading public intellectual impacting the source code of global culture, and has been called a trail-blazing visionary in opening up new possibilities for love, eros and relationship. He has led international spiritual movements and learning communities, as well as created and hosted for several seasons a popular national Israeli television program on culture, meaning, and spirit on Israel's leading network. Over the past 30 years, Dr. Gafni has developed educational programs and workshops rooted in traditional wisdom and yet fully adapted to the needs of the contemporary world.</p><h2>How to be a Billionaire: Proven Strategies from the Titans of Wealth</h2><p>"A truly enlightening work filled with fundamental strategies that have worked for others.Martin Fridson documents the essential principles inherent in every billionaire's success."<br> <br> -Gordon Bethune<br> Chairman of the Board and CEO<br> Continental Airlines<br> <br> Self-made billionaires all have one thing in common: they excel at making money.

As a result of his exhaustive research, Martin Fridson is able to explain the wealth-creation process from a unique perspective. As the reader will discover, there is no single formula for success, but there are certain categories into which these concepts can be placed.

Martin Fridson's <i>How to Be a Billionaire</i> sets its sights much higher, and therefore seems an even more appropriate (if somewhat less realistic) goal for today's tycoon wannabes. There are some 200 individuals in the U.S. alone who now breathe this rarefied air, writes Merrill Lynch managing director Fridson, and no reason why those who adopt their philosophies cannot join them. To that end, he studied more than a dozen of the self-made super-rich, including Sam Walton, Bill Gates, Wayne Huizenga, and Warren Buffett. He then synthesized their techniques for success into nine strategies: take monumental risks, do business in new ways, dominate your market, consolidate an industry, buy low, thrive on deals, outmanage the competition, invest in political influence, and resist unions. Dividing profiles of these high fliers into chapters focused on their prevailing principles, he shows how each played a critical role in the growth of an empire. Walton didn't invent discounting, for example; he tweaked existing practices for the late-20th-century marketplace. Likewise, Huizenga didn't start individual companies but integrated existing competitors into powerhouse organizations. While <i>Billionaire</i> may not be a true self-help manual, it does offer a fascinating glimpse at tactics used by those who've played the game and won. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>How to be a Billionaire Proven Strategies from the Titans of Wealth &#34;A truly enlightening work filled with fundamental strategies that have worked for others.

The contributors are leading art therapists who write from diverse perspectives, including Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and shamanic. They explain how their own spiritual and creative influences interact, finding expression in the use of art as a healing agent with specific populations, such as bereaved children, emotionally disturbed adolescents, and the homeless. The relationships between spirituality and visual art, art therapy and transpersonal psychology are examined. Story and image are interwoven in the spiritual journeys of therapists and clients, and suggested creative exercises make this an accessible, practical resource for those who desire to understand and execute an holistic method of therapy. Arguing that art therapists can mediate between the sacred and the mundane, this pioneering book is an affirmation of the transformative power of art therapy.</p><p>Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and other perspectives on how central spirituality is to the process of healingMimi Farrelly-Hansen, artist, art therapist and licensed professional counselor, is founder and current adjunct faculty member of the Art Therapy and Transpersonal Counseling Psychology program at Naropa University, Boulder, Colorado.

In this gripping work of historical detection, Richard Fletcher sheds light on the Anglo-Saxon world, bringing to life characters such as Ethelred the Unready and William the Conquerer.</p><p><br><strong>Richard Fletcher</strong> recently retired from the University of York where he was Professor of History. He is the author seven previous books, among them <em>The Quest for El Cid</em> which won the Wolfson Literary Award and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Award for History.<br><br>"It would be hard to imagine a better, more reliable introduction to the last days of the Anglo-Saxon world than this stirring book."--Michael Dirda, <em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"A swift and, by necessity, highly speculative account of some murders between 1016 and 1074 that reveal much about 11th-century English politics, religion, codes of honor, and kingship....

The current trend toward decreasing "Jewish cultural literacy" means that fewer people at the table are able to feel the relevance of the occasion. Kamin (Raising a Thoughtful Teenager, LJ 12/95), the senior rabbi of Cleveland's Temple-Tifereth Israel, has tried to fill this void with this work. It is not a handbook but reads as a poetic conversation to whet the reader's appetite and make Pesach meaningful. Kamin's work focuses especially on the elements of social responsibility relevant to Passover, from Pharaoh to the Civil Rights movement and giving to the hungry. Although his book does fill an important need, it will be less appealing to Orthodox or many Conservative Jews because of Kamin's offhand remarks on following Kashrut. However, for the majority of American Jews (either Reform or unaffiliated), the book serves as a useful meditation on the meaning of the holiday.?Andrew B. Wertheimer, Spertus Inst. of Jewish Studies, Chicago<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Rabbi Kamin says that the Passover text (the Haggadah) is not only important to Jews but also important in what he calls the text of the human heart. If Passover is about anything, he avers, it is about people remembering the past, and it is in this way that the holiday draws Jews together. Kamin discusses related subjects such as love, friendship, the power of memory, a child's curiosity, the purpose of Passover after the Holocaust, community sharing, empathy for the pain of others, and tolerance. A refreshing and relevant perspective on this sacred holiday. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>Islamic Art</h2><p><p>From the Alhambra to the Taj Mahal, from the Dome of the Rock to the ever evolving art of calligraphy, Barbara Brend traces the development of classic Islamic art from the seventh through the twentieth century.</p><p>The term "Islamic art" suggests a unity of style and purpose, and these works are in fact instantly recognizable for their subtlety of line and sumptuous detail. The Islamic world--from Arabia to North Africa and Spain, from Turkey to Central Asia and India--has a shared cultural heritage of extraordinary richness. Yet it is a common tradition that divides into a diversity of styles. So Brend narrates this history region by region, illustrating her discussion with superb examples drawn from all areas in which Muslim artists and craftsmen have excelled--mosque and palace architecture; the art of the book (calligraphy, painting, and bindings); and the decorative arts, including metalwork, carvings, mosaics, pottery, textiles, and carpets. Throughout, the author elucidates forms, aesthetic principles, themes, and imagery. And she points to sources and influences in the different periods--for example, the prominence of jade and chinoiserie after the Mongol invasion. In <i>Islamic Art</i> Brend expertly guides us through the splendors and delicacies of this classic tradition.</p></p><p><i>Islamic Art</i> is altogether an astounding achievement: interestingly informative, accurate, balanced in coverage and judgment. It is a wonderful book for students and museum-goers who wish to get acquainted with this tradition. (Oleg Grabar, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University)<br><br>This may well be the first book on this subject that is sensible, accessible, authoritative, thoughtfully organized--and does not require a table to support it. <i>Islamic Art</i> is also illustrated with remarkable finesse. (David Nalle <i>American-Arab Affairs</i>)<br><br>The intense blend of history and art insights makes for a volume which is scholarly and weighty, yet spellbinding. Discussions of dynasty changes, political influences on the development of Islam and Islamic art style, and transition points which fostered new Islamic art traditions accompany excellent, bright color illustrations of architectural and artistic Islamic heritage. (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>A sumptuously illustrated, accurate, balanced and critically aware historical survey of Islamic art and architecture from the beginnings until modern times, this work...provides clear, informative treatments of architecture, pottery and tilework, textiles and carpets, painting, glass, jade, metal work, calligraphy, and the arts of the book.

However, much current practice is based on antiquated and psychologically unsophisticated theories, leaving leaders inadequately prepared for the complex task of implementing change. Leading Change in Healthcare presents relationship-centered administration, an effective new evidence-based alternative to traditional culture change methodologies. It integrates fresh insights and methods from complexity science, positive psychology and relationship-centered care, enabling a more spontaneous and reflective approach to change management. This fosters greater organizational awareness and real participation, as well as improved productivity and creativity, as well as staff recruitment and retention. Case studies drawn from primary care, hospitals, long-term care, professional education, international NGOs and other settings, rather than emphasizing the end results, are demonstrations of how to apply relationship-centered administration in everyday practice. Leading Change in Healthcare is a key resource for all practitioners, students and teachers of healthcare management, medical educators, and leaders in all areas of healthcare provision. &#39;We need a new way of seeing, a new way of leading - and the authors provide a clear guide and resources for the path ahead. Leading Change in Healthcare offers hope - and a method.

His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Dedication of an Airport<br><br>For a full minute Jiggs stood before the window in a light spatter of last night's confetti lying against the windowbase like spent dirty foam, lightpoised on the balls of his greasestained tennis shoes, looking at the boots.

He leaned back on the counter, looking down at the hard tough shortchinned face, blueshaven, with a long threadlike and recently- stanched razorcut on it and in which the hot brown eyes seemed to snap and glare like a boy's approaching for the first time the aerial wheels and stars and serpents of a nighttime carnival; at the filthy raked swaggering peaked cap, the short thick musclebound body like the photographs of the one who two years before was lightmiddleweight champion of the army or Marine Corps or navy; the cheap breeches overcut to begin with and now skintight like both they and their wearer had been recently and hopelessly rained on and enclosing a pair of short stocky thick fast legs like a polo pony's, which descended into the tops of a pair of boots footless now and secured by two rivetted straps beneath the insteps of the tennis shoes.<br><br>"They are twenty-two and a half," the clerk said.<br><br>"All right. I'll take them. How late do you keep open at night?"<br><br>"Until six."<br><br>"Hell. I'll be out at the airport then. I wont get back to town until seven. How about getting them then?" Another clerk came up: the manager, the floorwalker.<br><br>"You mean you dont want them now?" the first said.<br><br>"No," Jiggs said. "How about getting them at seven?"<br><br>"What is it?" the second clerk said.<br><br>"Says he wants a pair of boots. Says he cant get back from the airport before seven oclock."<br><br>The second looked at Jiggs. "You a flyer?"<br><br>"Yair," Jiggs said. "Listen. Leave a guy here. I'll be back by seven. I'll need them tonight."<br><br>The second also looked down at Jiggs' feet. "Why not take them now?"<br><br>Jiggs didn't answer at all. He just said, "So I'll have to wait until tomorrow."<br><br>"Unless you can get back before six," the second said.<br><br>"O.K.," Jiggs said. "All right, mister. How much do you want down?" Now they both looked at him: at the face, the hot eyes: the appearance entire articulate and complete, badge regalia and passport, of an oblivious and incorrigible insolvency. "To keep them for me. That pair in the window."<br><br>The second looked at the first. "Do you know his size?"<br><br>"That's all right about that," Jiggs said. "How much?"<br><br>The second looked at Jiggs. "You pay ten dollars and we will hold them for you until tomorrow."<br><br>"Ten dollars? Jesus, mister. You mean ten percent. I could pay ten percent. down and buy an airplane."<br><br>"You want to pay ten percent. down?"<br><br>"Yair. Ten percent. Call for them this afternoon if I can get back from the airport in time."<br><br>"That will be two and a quarter," the second said. When Jiggs put his hand into his pocket they could follow it, fingernail and knuckle, the entire length of the pocket like watching the ostrich in the movie cartoon swallow the alarm clock. It emerged a fist and opened upon a wadded dollar bill and coins of all sizes. He put the bill into the first clerk's hand and began to count the coins onto the bill.<br><br>"There's fifty," he said. "Seventy-five. And fifteen's ninety, and twenty-five is.?.?.?.?.?.?." His voice stopped; he became motionless, with the twenty-five cent piece in his left hand and a half dollar and four nickels on his right palm. The clerks watched him put the quarter back into his right hand and take up the four nickels. "Let's see," he said. "We had ninety, and twenty will be--"<br><br>"Two dollars and ten cents," the second said. "Take back two nickels and give him the quarter."<br><br>"Two and a dime," Jiggs said. "How about taking that down?"<br><br>"You were the one who suggested ten percent."<br><br>"I cant help that. How about two and a dime?"<br><br>"Take it," the second said. The first took the money and went away. Again the second watched Jiggs' hand move downward along his leg, and then he could even see the two coins at the end of the pocket, through the soiled cloth.<br><br>"Where do you get this bus to the airport?" Jiggs said. The other told him. Now the first returned, with the cryptic scribbled duplicate of the sale; and now they both looked into the hot interrogation of the eyes.<br><br>"They will be ready for you when you call," the second said.<br><br>"Yair; sure," Jiggs said. "But get them out of the window."<br><br>"You want to examine them?"<br><br>"No. I just want to see them come out of that window." So again outside the window, his rubber soles resting upon that light confettispatter more forlorn than spattered paint since it had neither inherent weight nor cohesiveness to hold it anywhere, which even during the time that Jiggs was in the store had decreased, thinned, vanishing particle by particle into nothing like foam does, he stood until the hand came into the window and drew the boots out. Then he went on, walking fast with his short bouncing curiously stiffkneed gait. When he turned into Grandlieu Street he could see a clock, though he was already hurrying or rather walking at his fast stiff hard gait like a mechanical toy that has but one speed and though the clock's face was still in the shadow of the opposite streetside and what sunlight there was was still high, diffused, suspended in soft refraction by the heavy damp bayou-and-swamp- suspired air. There was confetti here too, and broken serpentine, in neat narrow swept windrows against wallangles and lightly vulcanised along the gutterrims by the flushing fireplugs of the past dawn, while, upcaught and pinned by the cryptic significant shields to doorfront and lamppost, the purple-and-gold bunting looped unbroken as a trolley wire above his head as he walked, turning at last at right angles to cross the street itself and meet that one on the opposite side making its angle too, to join over the center of the street as though to form an aerial and bottomless regalcolored cattlechute suspended at first floor level above the earth, and suspending beneath itself in turn, the outwardfacing cheeseclothlettered interdiction which Jiggs, passing, slowed looking back to read: Grandlieu Street CLOSED To Traffic 8:00 p.m.-Midnight<br><br>Now he could see the bus at the curb, where they had told him it would be, with its cloth banner fastened by the four corners across its broad stern to ripple and flap in motion, and the wooden sandwich board at the curb too: Bluehound to Feinman Airport. 75� The driver stood beside the open door; he too watched Jiggs' knuckles travel the length of the pocket. "Airport?" Jiggs said.<br><br>"Yes," the driver said. "You got a ticket?"<br><br>"I got seventy-five cents. Wont that do?"<br><br>"A ticket into the airport. Or a workman's pass. The passenger busses dont begin to run until noon." Jiggs looked at the driver with that hot pleasant interrogation, holding his breeches by one hand while he drew the other out of the pocket. "Are you working out there?" the driver said.<br><br>"Oh," Jiggs said. "Sure. I'm Roger Shumann's mechanic. You want to see my license?"<br><br>"That'll be all right," the driver said. "Get aboard." In the driver's seat there lay folded a paper: one of the colored ones, the pink or the green editions of the diurnal dogwatches, with a thick heavy typesplattered front page filled with ejaculations and pictures. Jiggs paused, stooped, turning.<br><br>"Have a look at your paper, cap," he said. But the driver did not answer. Jiggs took up the paper and sat in the next seat and took from his shirt pocket a crumpled cigarette pack and upended and shook into his other palm from it two cigarette stubs and put the longer one back into the crumpled paper and into his shirt again and lit the shorter one, pursing it away from his face and slanting his head aside to keep the matchflame from his nose. Three more men entered the bus, two of them in overalls and the third in a kind of porter's cap made of or covered by purple-and-gold cloth in alternate stripes, and then the driver came and sat sideways in his seat.<br><br>"You got a ship in the race today, have you?" he said.<br><br>"Yair," Jiggs said. "In the three-seventy-five cubic inch."<br><br>"How does it look to you? Do you think you will have a chance?"<br><br>"We might if they would let us fly it in the two hundred cubic inch," Jiggs said. He took three quick draws from the cigarette stub like darting a stick at a snake and snapped it through the stillopen door as though it were the snake, or maybe a spider, and opened the paper. "Ship's obsolete. It was fast two years ago, but that's two years ago.

Grandma said, "It'll come a tide." It did, washing away gardens, porches, pigs, and chickens. Four families on a hillside cope with the flood, driving to higher ground to wait it out, fetching their boat, and gathering stray family members. After the narrator's night at Grandma's, the rain stops and they all return to "make friends with a shovel." The story is lyrically told with sly humor, and expanded to hilarity by Gammell's rollicking, wet, full-of-action, full-color cartoons. The characters could get together with those he did for Rylant's The Relatives Came (Bradbury, 1985). The underlying colored-pencil technique is in his typical style, but for rain he uses watercolor. His work is jolly as always and brimming with life, but there is one small nit to pick: the chickens and the pigs smile as the water sweeps them away. The jovial art may also tend somewhat to counter the final lines of the book: ". . . I'll hold my breath/ and hope Grandma won't say,/ 'Children, it'll come a tide.' " That is quibbling, however. Children and adults alike will love this big-hearted book. Reassuringly, it shows feisty people coping with trouble and coming out all right, thus taking some of the fear out of a potentially terrifying experience. --Helen Gregory, Grosse Pointe Public Library, MI<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Four days and nights of rain and snow in the mountains and, Grandma predicts, it'll "come a tide." And indeed, fragile gardens are swept away, pigs and chickens float merrily by, and families scramble for higher ground. When the water recedes, everyone pitches in, excavating household goods--their "buried treasures"--with good cheer. This is a gem of a picture book, a seamless collaboration between author and artist. Lyon's folksy narrative captures the cadence of country speech without striking a false or condescending note. And Gammell memorably renders the strength and individuality of mountain folk. Using drips and splotches of watercolors as well as drawing more traditional, slanting rain, he brings the reader into the storm, making it seem as though it has rained on the book itself. One feels buoyed by the characters' matter-of-fact resilience; this is a striking and thoroughly captivating portrait of grace and humor, in the face of adversity.

Two well-respected writers and researchers, Bob Frank and Ben Bernanke, have shown that the less-is-more approach affords similar gains in introductory economics. The authors introduce a <em>coherent short list of core principles</em> and reinforce them by illustrating and applying each in numerous contexts. With engaging questions, explanations and exercises, the authors help students relate economic principles to a host of everyday experiences such as going to the ATM or purchasing airline tickets. Throughout this process, the authors encourage students to become &#x201c;economic naturalists:&#x201d; people who employ basic economic principles to understand and explain what they observe in the world around them.</p><p> <em>Principles of Economics</em>, fifth edition, is thoroughly updated with examples that connect to current events such as the financial crisis of 2008 and Great Recession of 2007-2009 as well as other topics commonly discussed in the media. In addition, the text is paired with McGraw-Hill&#x2019;s market-leading online assignment and assessment solution Connect Economics, providing tools to enhance course management and student learning.</p><p> Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, and how they need it, so that your class time is more engaging and effective.</p></p><p>Robert H.

But probability and statistics are becoming increasingly important in today&#x2019;s society. As the basic ideas are being taught in elementary schools through college, it&#x2019;s important that everyone has a basic understanding of probability theory. Probability theory explains the happenings that occur due to chance. Although it is not possible to predict for certain the individual outcome of a chance process, it is possible to determine outcomes in the &#x201c;long run,&#x201d; and to predict the probability that something will eventually occur. This book will present the basics of probability in a non-rigorous manner. Only an understanding of arithmetic and some basic algebra are necessary to learn these ideas. No high-powered mathematical notation or formal proofs will be used, rather the concepts will be developed from examples using coins, dice, cards, and other common probability devices.</p><p><b>DON'T ROLL THE DICE LEARNING PROBABILITY!</b> <p> Now anyone who ever flipped a coin, played cards, or placed a bet can grasp the principles that govern probability -- without formal training, unlimited time, or an Einstein IQ.

This anniversary edition of Daufuskie Island boldly contrasts the changes caused by economic growth, which occurred after land developers began building expensive homes and hotels.<br>At the time of first publication, about eighty-five permanent residents of the Island lived in fewer than fifty homes. Many still spoke their native Gullah dialect. This pocket of their culture was all that remained of a thriving antebellum black society built by freed slaves that purchased the land from the original plantation owners, who had left the Island.<br>In order to create this expanded edition, Jeanne returned to the original contact sheets and discovered many overlooked photographs. Now, twenty-five years later, this seasoned artist, with the benefit of distance and reflection, has perfectly interpreted an evanescent way of life, a world washed away by the ineluctable tides of time.<br>With 110 photographs, many never before published, Daufuskie Island is a clarion call to preserve the remnants of island life and the culture of the rural south.</p><p>"Moutoussamy-Ashe's personal fascination with South Carolina's coastal region led her further to Daufuskie.

The transition to a green economy depends on cities. For the first time in human history, the majority of the people on the planet live in urban areas. If we are to avert climate catastrophe, we will need our cities to coexist with nature without destroying it. Many places are already investing in the infrastructure of the future&#x2015;including renewable energy, energy efficiency, mass and personal transit, and advanced sewage and waste management&#x2015;but the modern city still has a long way to go.<br><br>In <i>The Sustainable City</i>, Steven Cohen provides a broad and engaging overview of the urban systems of the twenty-first century, surveying policies and projects already under way in cities around the world and pointing to more ways progress can be made. Cohen discusses the sustainable city from an organizational-management and public-policy perspective that emphasizes the local level, looking at case studies of existing legislation, programs, and public-private partnerships that strive to align modern urban life and sustainability. From waste management in Beijing to energy infrastructure in Africa to public space in Washington, D.C., there are concrete examples of what we can do right now. Cohen synthesizes the disparate strands of sustainable city planning in an approachable and applicable guide that highlights how these issues touch our lives on a daily basis, whether the transportation we take, where our energy comes from, or what becomes of our food waste. Providing recommendations and insights with immediacy and relevance, this book has invaluable lessons for anyone seeking to link public policy to promoting a sustainable lifestyle.</p><p>Steven Cohen is the former executive director of Columbia University's Earth Institute and a professor in the practice of public affairs at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.

A must read for current and future leaders in a rapidly urbanizing world. (William Eimicke, Columbia University)<br><br>At the city level, the question of how to handle water resources, energy use, and transportation is not abstract but concrete. Citizens, planners, businesspeople, and policy makers can easily see the problems and how a sustainable approach would be beneficial. Steven Cohen draws on his extensive teaching and public management experience in documenting the kinds of sustainability measures that have been successful in major cities around the world, and he points to what other cities realistically can do in the future.

But few of us ask why. Why does the beautiful in Mozart stand apart, as though untouched by human hands? At the same time, why does it inspire intimacy rather than distant admiration, love rather than awe? And how does Mozart's music create and sustain its buoyant and ever-renewable effects? In <i>Mozart's Grace</i>, Scott Burnham probes a treasury of passages from many different genres of Mozart's music, listening always for the qualities of Mozartean beauty: beauty held in suspension; beauty placed in motion; beauty as the uncanny threshold of another dimension, whether inwardly profound or outwardly transcendent; and beauty as a time-stopping, weightless suffusion that comes on like an act of grace.</p><br><p> Throughout the book, Burnham engages musical issues such as sonority, texture, line, harmony, dissonance, and timing, and aspects of large-scale form such as thematic returns, retransitions, and endings. Vividly describing a range of musical effects, Burnham connects the ways and means of Mozart's music to other domains of human significance, including expression, intimation, interiority, innocence, melancholy, irony, and renewal. We follow Mozart from grace to grace, and discover what his music can teach us about beauty and its relation to the human spirit. The result is a newly inflected view of our perennial attraction to Mozart's music, presented in a way that will speak to musicians and music lovers alike.</p></p><p><p>"How does Scott Burnham do it? He manages the Mozartean feat of effortlessness, clarity, and beauty in luminous prose that makes musical processes give up their secrets and yet retain the sense of their mysterious power. The satisfying shape of this book moves with revelatory imagery from Mozart's limpid opening phrases through disruptive thresholds toward thematic returns both weightless and profound. A full landscape of emotional states is thrillingly revealed. Burnham paints Mozart's achievements in strikingly vivid and personal ways even as he places them within the broad conceptual fields of musical beauty and ideas of the self between the Enlightenment and romanticism. A stirring book."<b>--Elaine Sisman, Columbia University</b></p><p>"No one hears with more joy than Scott Burnham, and we are all the richer for it. Any performer will find here inspiration for focusing awareness on the particulars of Mozart's language. The elements of his music are poetically teased apart in order that we may be granted space to listen and feel more deeply. Burnham offers us a primer on how to open oneself to music, develop the sensitivity to be vulnerable to its specific intimacies and charms, and, in so doing, experience the profound pleasure of connection with Mozart's works."<b>--Mark Steinberg, Brentano String Quartet</b></p><p>"Concentrating on music's effects, this distinctive and original book focuses on the most important elements of Mozart's music. Moving beyond conventional analysis and using the figurative powers of language with skill and imagination, Burnham's personal and carefully conceived book will be read and valued by lovers of Mozart's art."<b>--Karol Berger, author of <i>Bach's Cycle, Mozart's Arrow: An Essay on the Origins of Musical Modernity</i></b></p><p>"This virtuosic and deeply touching book distills a lifetime of listening to Mozart into a powerful work of appreciation. Writing from an unapologetically personal point of view, Burnham examines certain passages in detail to describe how a particularly Mozartean beauty comes about.

Now an MIT professor emeritus, he views the nuclear arms race as a triumph of insanity. In U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations, he urges interdependence, cooperation and mutual reductions in nuclear weapons. In his wise, humane, snappy essays, the Vienna-born physicist, fond of Rilke and Mozart, shows us the human face of science. For him, physics is one highly developed expression of our urge to find out where we stand in the environment and the cosmos. Lucid chapters offer a quick overview of recent discoveries from quarks to investigations of chaos, disorder and nonlinear physics. Weisskopf also reminisces about working with Neils Bohr and with his own mentor, Wolfgang Pauli, who, we learn, had a keen interest in mysticism and the Jewish Kabbalah. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Family Pilgrim&#39;s Progress</h2><p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a man called Christian who lived in the City of Destruction with his wife and four children.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Van Eyck to Gossaert: Towards a Northern Renaissance</h2><p><p>Objects of beauty and prestige with their rich color and fine detail, early Netherlandish oil paintings were among the most widely sought-after works of the Renaissance.

Genesis A U T H O R , P L A C E A N D DAT E O F W R I T I N G Genesis is, strictly speaking, an anonymous work. Historical tradition, however, as well as Biblical attestation, assigns authorship to Moses (see, e.g., Mk 12:26; Lk 24:27; Jn 1:45; Ro 10:5; 2Co 3:15). Moses� author ship would not have required him to write the entire book. In fact, all of the Genesis events took place long before Moses was born, indicating that he must have used sources.We might view Moses as an editor/historian who, in addition to receiving God&#39;s direct and supernatural communication, drew together details of the family histories of Abraham and his descendants, as they existed in the Israelite community in Egypt, into a single text. Scholars who question Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch (Ge--Dt) generally support one or another variant of the Documentary Hypothesis (see &#39;The Documentary Hypothesis&#39; on p. 15). If Moses did indeed write/compile Genesis, he must have done so during the Israelites&#39; exodus wandering period, probably between 1440 and 1400 B.C. (see &#39;The Store Cities of Pithom and Rameses&#39; on p. 86, &#39;The Pharaoh of the Exodus&#39; on p. 98, &#39;The Date of the Exodus&#39; on p. 106, &#39;The Hyksos and the Old Testament&#39; on p. 121 and &#39;The Conquest of Canaan&#39; on p. 310). Those scholars who suggest that the Pentateuch was written as a single work during the exile typically place the date of authorship at about 550 B.C. A U D I E N C E Genesis records the stories of the creation, the fall into sin, the flood, the call of Abraham and the early history of the ancestors of Israel. The Genesis stories were probably circulated among the Israelites living in Egypt, reminding them of their familial and spiritual heritage and explaining their current situation. Genesis preserved individual stories (like those about Joseph) that could afford hope to God&#39;s enslaved people. Promises to Abraham about the future of his progeny (e.g., 15:1--7) also would have encouraged them. Later, Israelites directly involved in the exodus, as well as their succeeding generations, no doubt read Genesis in order to understand this piece of the great saga of their national origin. The fulfillment of God&#39;s historical promises to the patriarchs served as a testimony to his continuing faithfulness. C U LT U R A L FA C T S A N D H I G H L I G H T S Genesis records the birth and early history of humankind. Not only did God create the physical world, but he also formed man and woman in his own image and endowed them with the gift of free will. Over time changes took place, including humanity&#39;s fall into sin and the resultant great flood. Tribes, cities and civilizations ebbed and flowed, rising and declining in a rhythm that has characterized human history ever since. Centuries passed, and at some point God chose to concentrate his particular attention on one individual from an ordinary, idol-worshiping family---who in his turn opted to listen and obey. From such unimpressive roots began the triumphant---if often temporarily tragic--- saga of redemption history. T I M E L I N E INTRODUCTION TO G E N E S I S 3 A S Y O U R E A D Note how quickly and irreversibly the human race turned its back on Eden and on perfect fellowship with God (chs. 2--3) and how God responded (chs. 4--8). Then, through the unlikely choice of a still-childless patriarch, God began to form the family from which the Israelite nation would spring (chs. 11--30; 49). Study the life of Joseph, from his years of slavery to his meteoric rise to power in a strange land to his revelation to his unsuspecting brothers (chs. 42--45). This book explains how and why the Israelites came to live in Egypt, setting the stage for what would happen to this special people in Exodus and beyond. D I D Y O U K N O W ? * An individual in the ancient Near East could claim rights to a well on someone else&#39;s land (21:25--30). * The bride price paid by a husband&#39;s family was to be held in trust to provide for the wife if she were to find herself abandoned or widowed (31:14--16). * A man&#39;s seal, cord and staff were symbols of his individual and corporate identity---the ancient equivalent of an I.D. card or signature (38:17--18). * Both the Egyptians and the Babylonians compiled &#39;dream books,&#39; containing sample dreams with keys to their interpretation (40:8). * The philosophy behind the Egyptian practice of embalming was a belief that the body was to be preserved as a repository for the soul after death (50:2--3).</p><h2>These American Lands: Parks, Wilderness, and the Public Lands: Revised and Expanded Edition</h2><p>Over 634 million acres of the United States -- nearly a million square miles -- are federally owned. <i>These American Lands</i> is both a history and a celebration of that inheritance. First published in 1986, the book was hailed by Wallace Stegner as "the only indispensable narrative history of the public lands." This completely revised and updated edition is an unsurpassed resource for everyone who cares about, visits, or works with public land in the United States. With over 75 pages of new material, the volume covers: national parks national forests national resource lands wildlife refuges designated wildernesses wild and scenic rivers Alaska landsnational trails Each chapter outlines the history of the unit of public lands under discussion, clarifies the resource use and policy conflicts that are currently besetting it, and provides a detailed agenda of management, expansion, and preservation goals.</p><p>This authoritative and stirring assessment of our public lands - the first book ever published to give the history and propose the future of each unit of a federal trust that today accounts for approximately one-third of America&#39;s landmass - begins with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872. The national park concept, which the historian Lord Bryce called the best idea to come out of the New World, was the first attempt by a national government to preserve land for future generations. Since then, hundreds of additional parks, monuments, historic sites, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges have been added to a vast system of public lands that also includes national forest and Bureau of Land Management holdings. The preservation of our nation&#39;s natural heritage has become a model throughout the world, but the fight to keep public land unspoiled - from the Everglades to Alaskan mountain ranges - is never-ending, as this lively and dramatic history of America reveals. This preservationist idea did not come naturally: the myth of the land&#39;s superabundance dominated the thinking of Americans even after the frontier was officially closed one hundred years ago. Frontier greed and carelessness, combined with business and political pressures for local control, continue to threaten our parks, forests, and wilderness lands today. The battles over these lands, especially as their outcomes determine present and future patterns of land use, will continue to define our civilization. These American Lands assesses management policy within each unit and demonstrates why the citizen&#39;s vigilance is necessary today if future Americans are to look upon our natural legacy as the crowningachievement of the twentieth century.This collaborative volume is part history and part aggressive advocacy on behalf of conservation of America's federal lands. The history is legislative and administrative, covering a series of congressional acts and the federal managers who tried to administer them. There are separate chapters on the work history and conflicts among such agencies as the National Park Service, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. Then, at the end of each chapter, the authors spell out how federal land policy should be changed to assure sound preservation and conservation. The suggestions are judicious and sensible, and the case that such conservation is in our national interest is convincing. A helpful appendix to federal land laws and statistics concludes the work.

Indian maps--made on buffalo skins, rocks, bark, and, later, paper--claimed territorial rights, explained treaties among nations, delineated trade routes, and showed the locations of resources. Many of those maps wound up in dusty attics and the back shelves of museums, where Warhus has hunted them out; his stories of finding these lost treasures are as illuminating as his interpretations of what might be called pre-scientific ways of graphically describing the land. These maps, he writes, are of importance today not only for their own sake, but also as evidence of historic holdings in current claims over lost territories.</p><p>An absorbing exploration of Native American ways of mapping the land. Warhus, a museum curator, unfolds an account that is at once full of scientific complexities and of human interest. In looking at Native American maps, he invites the reader to consider the detailed knowledge of ``geography, political allegiances, and economic relations'' reflected in them, knowledge largely destroyed in the course of conquest. In case study after case study, he shows how maps made on buffalo skins, rocks, birch bark, and paper, maps that claimed territorial rights and explained treaties with other Indian nations, were simply ignored; many of those maps wound up in the drawing rooms and attics of the conquerors. Some eventually came to rest in museum collections. Warhus has been diligent in hunting these maps out, and we should be glad of it, for many of them are astonishingly detailed--one, made by an Iowa Indian in the mid-1850s, shows the tributaries of the Mississippi River nearly as well as any modern chart, while another, made by one of the last members of the Beothuck people of Newfoundland, is an extraordinary cultural atlas of the northern Atlantic seaboard at the time of the European arrival. To his account of the making of these maps Warhus adds a rich anecdotal history, telling the stories of the kidnaped Indian Miguel, forced to make maps of the southern Plains for the Spanish conquistadors, and of other Native Americans whose knowledge of the countryside was used to the invaders' advantage. Warhus closes his book with a look at modern efforts by the Hopi, Zuni, and other peoples to combine traditional geographies with modern mapmaking techniques, efforts that may be fruitful in pressing indigenous claims to lost territory. This richly illustrated work is a valuable contribution to Native American studies. (90 color and b&amp;w illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Reprint.</p><p>Film historians Patrick McGilligan and Paul Buhle have assembled a collection of interviews with film writers, directors, and actors whose careers were interrupted by the blacklist imposed in the wake of congressional probes into alleged Communist influence over the motion-picture industry. The subjects, including two of the "Hollywood Ten," Alvah Bessie and Ring Lardner Jr., systematically debunk the notion that there was an extensive conspiracy to load mainstream movies with "Red propaganda." "We were in the film business not to change the world but to make films," recalls writer-director Abraham Polonsky. "To change the world we were involved in other kinds of things, like the labor struggle in Hollywood." Screenwriter Paul Jarrico concurs: "The Communist Party was not a revolutionary organization, not in the period when I was in it. It was a reformist organization, and for most of the years I was in it, it was the tail to the liberal-Democrat kite." (Recent historical research, it must be noted, indicates that Kremlin officials <i>did</i> in fact wield substantial influence over the CPUSA platform. Evidence for the attempted subversion of America's movies, however, remains elusive.)<p> Some of those shut out of the industry weren't even actual Communists, but ran into them as part of broader leftist activities. Character actor Lionel Stander, for example, became an actor in order to support his extravagant lifestyle; when the film jobs disappeared, he waited out the studios on the stock market. "It seems that if my face or figure got on the screen, so delicate was the balance of the American socioeconomic and political scene at the time that I would throw the thing right off the tightrope," he recalls drolly. "But I could go to Wall Street and invest the savings of widows and orphans with impunity."

D�rer was also the first artist outside Italy to leave behind a large body of writing. Contemporaries and succeeding generations added their accounts of him to this documentary legacy. Jeffrey Ashcroft&#x2019;s new book provides the first English translation of the whole corpus of D�rer&#x2019;s writings; the legal, financial, and administrative documentation of his life and work; and what others wrote about him during his life and in the following century. Translations of primary documents are accompanied by extensive commentary, providing Anglophone scholars access to German-language research.

It's with mixed feelings that he's left New York City in the first place to finish high school in the hallowed halls of the mostly white, very preppy New England school -- but now that Spoon is back home, he realizes how much he's come to like his prep-school life and new friends. He's missed his girlfriend, though, and is shocked to discover upon his return that the bright young poet she was when he left has become a drug addict.</p><p>Walter Dean Myers is the 2012 - 2013 National Ambassador for Young People's Literature.

Printz Award. He lives in Jersey City, New Jersey.<br>Grade 8 Up-Anthony "Spoon" Witherspoon, 17, leaves Harlem, and his girl, Gabi, to spend his senior year at Wallingford Academy in Connecticut, with the hope that he will get into an Ivy League college. While he adjusts to prep-school life and navigates the racial and social divides of the haves and the want-to-haves, Gabi's life comes undone. Her mother is dying, her younger brother may be running with a gang, and her blind grandfather has come to stay. When Spoon comes home for Christmas, Gabi is different. She's thinner, certainly, and so is her spirit. Spoon discovers a needle in her room and "the beast," heroin, is uncovered. Gabi-a clear-eyed, sassy Dominicana who writes poetry and dreams of attending Columbia-explains that she has lost the road that once ran through her life to her future. Most of the first-person narrative takes place during the holiday break in Harlem, and Myers's descriptions of the streets and people-the bright, clean, working-class hope and the slate-gray bankruptcy of drugs and crime-are photographically authentic and dizzyingly musical. Spoon's observations are philosophical and precocious, but the story races along at the pace of his anxieties-about a future, with or without Gabi, and about his place in Harlem and in the world. The language is simple and clean; the plot unfolds seamlessly; and the characters emerge shaky, worldly wise, and cautiously optimistic.<br><i>Johanna Lewis, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From dancer to actress to film-maker to photographer to diver, she has excelled in each field and is one of the most important and controversial artists of the 20th century. Her contributions to the art and technique of film-making were vast, most notably in her epochal film ""Olympia"" (1938). Critically acclaimed during the 1930's for her work under the Hitler administration and harshly criticized after the war, Riefenstahl surged on, completing the famous ""Tiefland"" in 1954. In the 1960s and 70s she traveled to Africa and extensively photographed East Africa and the Nuba tribes in Sudan, publishing three books. Ready for yet another change, she took up deep-sea diving at the age of 71, beginning a new chapter as an underwater photographer.<p>Though she has attracted much attention throughout her life and has been the subject of many books, articles, and films, Leni Riefenstahl Five Lives is the first book to showcase her entire career in pictures. Produced in collaboration with Riefenstahl herself, the book includes her most famous images as well as many previously unpublished pictures from her private archives. The main body of the book features photographs (without text) spanning Riefenstahl's entire set of careers, with pictures of her on stage as a dancer and on the set as an actress and film-maker, as well as film stills and her own photographs (precise commentaries about the pictures can be found in the comprehensive appendix). The illustrated biography, international bibliography, and detailed filmography complement the illustrative section with extensive information about her personaland professional lives. Fans and critics alike will be impressed with this sweeping visual tribute.</p></p><p><i>Leni Riefenstahl: Five Lives</i> traces the fascinating and controversial life and work of the famous German photographer-filmmaker. Riefenstahl started her creative career as an aspiring dancer in the 1920s in Germany and then became a movie actress. She starred in a number of films, taking challenging roles that were sometimes dangerous and physically rigorous, such as the ice-bound and skiing roles in <i>Storm over Mont Blanc</i>, <i>The White Flame</i>, and <i>SOS Iceberg</i>. These outdoor films foretold the spirit of adventure that later guided Riefenstahl's photography career.<p> The crux of controversy that overshadows Riefenstahl's career is her handpicked appointment by Adolf Hitler to direct the infamous Nazi party rally film <i>Triumph of the Will</i>. Although, according to her memoirs, Riefenstahl tried to withdraw from the film, she created a work that depicted Hitler's plane descending from the clouds as if it carried a god, and she has been accused "of having significantly increased, by means of this film, the emotional bond of the Germans to Hitler." Riefenstahl then went on to direct the German film <i>Olympia</i> covering the 1936 Olympics. With WWII came great change and Riefenstahl's eventual imprisonment by the French. In her later years, she continued her photography career by documenting her trips to Africa and getting her scuba license in her 70s. Her close-up underwater pictures of sea life float like a dream in vivid color. For as damning as her association with the Nazis is, Riefenstahl is a complex and talented artist. This book is full of remarkable images of her acting and directorial career as well as her still photography, and it includes a detailed biography of her life and career--complete with family and personal pictures. <i>--J.P.

Her close-up underwater pictures of sea life float like a dream in vivid colour. As damning as her association with the Nazis is, Riefenstahl is a complex and talented artist. This book is full of remarkable images of her acting and directorial career as well as her still-photography. Includes a detailed biography of her life and career complete with family and personal pictures.--JP Cohen ---JP Cohen<br><br>The striking front cover on this book is a publicity still as Junta, in the movie "The Blue Light" 1932. As impressive as the cover is, it gets better when you open it to reveal hundreds of artistically shot photos. Dr. Ruth says bigger is not necessarily better. However in this case it is; something about the size of the photographs add to their striking appearance. Most are in grainy black and white with some color sections. This book is just a wee to large to fit in my oversized bookshelf. So I am making a larger shelf to display the books front view. Just as you assume that this is a great coffee table book you will find that there is more too it. Luckily the pictures are not cluttered or distracted by alpha pneumonics. All the descriptions are in a separate section. The title of the book is appropriate as it portray s the different vocations of Leni.

It is the only study of Social Darwinism that combines the study of individual thinkers with the distinctive ideological themes (e.g., eugenics) and does so in a comprehensive historical and comparative framework. A wide spectrum of academic readers will enjoy Dr. Hawkins&#39; lucid and subtle analysis and find it a useful guide through a difficult and complex subject.</p><p>Mike Hawkins is Reader in Social and Political Thought, School of Social Science, Kingston University."Hawkins provides a keen analysis of Social Darwinism in an important and thought-provoking work that will surely become the standard work on the subject for some time to come. It is a superb corrective to the fairly popular revisionist interpretation of Social Darwinism propagated by Robert Bannister and others....Hawkins has provided a useful definition and analysis of Social Darwinism on which future scholarship can build....his work is useful and can serve as a springboard for further study. It will also serve as a useful text in a variety of courses in the history of science and intellectual history." Richard Weikart, H-Net Reviews<br><br>"...this is an erudite book that deserves to be read. General readers; upper-division undergraduates and above." P. Kivisto, Choice<br><br>"Mike Hawkins has produced a comprehensive, informative, and useful review of the emergence and development of Social Darwinism in American and European thought. He has succeeded in showing that Social Darwinism constitues a world view that is much more complex and multifaceted than is often recognized." Richard Machalek, Cithara<br><br>"We are fortunate to have this sweeping and accessible survey." Terence Hall, The Annals of the American Academy<br><br>"This new book by Mike Hawkins is valuable because it offers a clear and cogent explanation of the meaning and history of Scoial Darwinism." Larry Arnhart, Politics and the Life Sciences</p><h2>The Life and Writings of Abraham Lincoln (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>Abraham Lincoln, the greatest of all American presidents, left us a vast legacy of writings, some of which are among the most famous in our history. Lincoln was a marvelous writer--from his humblest letter to his greatest speeches. His sentences were so memorably crafted that many resonate across the years. "Fourscore and seven years ago," begins the Gettysburg address, "our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."<br><br>In 1940, the prolific author and historian Philip Van Doren Stern produced this volume as a guide to Lincoln's life through his writings. Stern's "The Life of Abraham Lincoln," which precedes the writings, is a full biography of the man and includes a detailed chronology.</p><p>He was the most eloquent of American presidents, with the possible exception of FDR, and the moral vision that sustained the nation during the Civil War illuminates nearly every page in this hefty collection of Abraham Lincoln's speeches, writings, and correspondence. It's not just the famous phrases--"mystic chords of memory" (first inaugural address), "government of the people, by the people, for the people" (Gettysburg Address), "with malice toward none" (second inaugural address)--that resonate. It's an artistic and political genius that could express complex ethical questions in simple, compelling language, as when Lincoln defined slavery's defenders as holding the "same tyrannical principle" as Europe's kings: "the same spirit that says, 'You toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.'" Editor Philip Van Doren Stern's annotations provide helpful background, and his 200-page biographical essay ably encapsulates the principal developments in Lincoln's life and thought as they were known in 1940, when this volume was first published. The extreme privation of his youth, the terrible melancholy that often afflicted him, and the sorrows of his personal life make Lincoln's public achievements all the more staggering. Stern wisely respects the mysterious alchemy by which a plain man became a statesman; this respectful anthology seeks only to present Lincoln, not to explain him. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"A great man, tender of heart, strong of nerve, boundless patience and broadest sympathy, with no motive apart from his country."<br>--Frederick Douglass</p><h2>Mark Twain: The Contemporary Reviews (American Critical Archives, Series Number 11)</h2><p>This book is the first systematic, comprehensive gathering of the reviews (primarily in the United States and Britain) of Mark Twain&#39;s books published up until 1917. The reviews collected here give the reader an unfiltered sense of how Twain&#39;s books and his reputation looked to his audience at the time. In addition, by devoting attention to each of Twain&#39;s books, this volume moves away from the current, distorting emphasis on a small number of publications and thus provides a broader perspective on Twain&#39;s career.</p><p>"...a genuine advance in our grasp of Twain's] contemporary reputation." To Wit<br><br>"...more than just a worthwhile book....Budd actively engages the past and the "lively and educative" function of reviewers and their reviews." Jason G. Horn, Mark Twain Forum<br><br>"Any historicist account of Twain...would benefit from a close look at Louis J. Budd's collection of contemporary reviews. The results of this wonderfully rewarding search are in part borne out in the equally rewarding Mark Twain: The Contemporary Reviews, a volume that should assist not only those students of Budd's who will endeavor to assay the biographical record for themselves but also most Twain scholars with an interest in Twain in his own time."

Robert Oppenheimer, a leading physicist in the Manhattan Project, recognized that scientific inquiry and discovery could no longer be separated from their effect on political decision-making, social responsibility, and human endeavor in general. He openly addressed issues of common concern and as a scientist accepted the responsibility brought about by nuclear physics and the atom bomb. In this collection of essays and speeches, Oppenheimer discusses the shift in scientific awareness and its impact on education, the question of openness in a society forced to keep secrets, the conflict between individual concerns and public and political necessity, the future of science and its effects on future politics---in short, the common and uncommon sense we find in our modern day reality.</p></p><p><p>"I think that we will not be very successful in discouraging other power from this course [of a nuclear military program] unless we show, by our own example and conviction, that we regard nuclear armament as a transitory, dangerous, and degrading phase of the world&#x2019;s history..."</p> <p>These words could have been said today; that they were said more than twenty years ago, by one of the "fathers" of the atom bomb, gives them even greater impact. J. Robert Oppenheimer, a leading physicist in the Manhattan Project, recognized that scientific inquiry and discovery could no longer be separated from their effect on political decision-making, social responsibility, and human endeavor in general. He openly addressed issues of common concern and as a scientist accepted the responsibility brought about by nuclear physics.</p> <p>This collection of essays and speeches, only a few of which have been previously published, presents an extraordinary thinker and scientist as well as a compassionate human being. No issue is too small or too large if it is in some way connected to the emergence of a weapon as terrible and powerful as the atom bomb. Oppenheimer discusses the shift in scientific awareness and its impact on education, the question of openness in a society forced to keep secrets, the conflict between individual concerns and public and political necessity, the future of science and its effects on future politics---in short, the common and uncommon sense we find in our modern day reality.</p> <p>Uncommon Sense presents a responsible scientist and a concerned man who foresaw the problems the discovery of fission would create. And we should no neglect to read between the lines: The peak of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s career coincided with the McCarthy era, the repercussions of which strongly affected his personal and professional life. The themes of openness and freedom becomes, therefore, recurring concerns in this collection of essays and speeches.</p></p><h2>Ezra Pound: Poet: Volume III: The Tragic Years 1939-1972</h2><p>This third and final volume of A. David Moody's critical life of Ezra Pound presents Pound's personal tragedy in a tragic time. In this volume, we experience the 1939-1945 World War, and Pound's hubristic involvement in Fascist Italy's part in it; we encounter the grave moral and intellectual error of Pound holding the Jewish race responsible for the war; and his consequent downfall, being charged with treason, condemned as an anti-Semite, and shut up for twelve years in an institution for the insane. Further, we see Pound stripped for life, by his own counsel and wife, of his civil and human rights. <br><br>Pound endured what was inflicted upon him, justly and unjustly, without complaint; and continued his lifetime's effort to promote, in and through his Cantos and his translations, a consciousness of a possible humane and just social order. The contradictions run deep and compel, as tragedy does, a steady and unprejudiced contemplation and an answering depth of comprehension.<br></p><p><br>A.

In simple, often poetic, language, Daisetz Suzuki describes his conception of Zen and its historical evolution. He connects Zen to the philosophy of the samurai, and subtly portrays the relationship between Zen and swordsmanship, haiku, tea ceremonies, and the Japanese love of nature. Suzuki's contemplative work is enhanced by anecdotes, poetry, and illustrations showing silk screens, calligraphy, and examples of architecture.</p><p> Since its original publication in 1938, this important work has played a major role in shaping conceptions of Zen's influence on Japanese traditional arts. Richard Jaffe's introduction acquaints a new generation of readers with Suzuki's life and career in both Japan and America. Jaffe discusses how <i>Zen and Japanese Culture</i> was received upon its first publication and analyzes the book in light of contemporary criticism, especially by scholars of Japanese Buddhism.</p></p><p><b>Daisetz T.

In 1907, a scholarship took her to England, where she developed a passionate devotion to the suffrage movement. Upon her return to the United States, Alice became the leader of the militant wing of the American suffrage movement. Calling themselves "Silent Sentinels," she and her followers were the first protestors to picket the White House. Arrested and jailed, they went on hunger strikes and were force-fed and brutalized. Years before Gandhi's campaign of nonviolent resistance, and decades before civil rights demonstrations, Alice Paul practiced peaceful civil disobedience in the pursuit of equal rights for women. </p><p>With her daring and unconventional tactics, Alice Paul eventually succeeded in forcing President Woodrow Wilson and a reluctant U.S. Congress to pass the Nineteenth Amendment, granting women the right to vote. Here at last is the inspiring story of the young woman whose dedication to women's rights made that long-held dream a reality. </p><p>"Alice Paul was a visionary and a pioneer.

This moving portrayal of the brilliant activist Alice Paul and her dedicated companions in prison and on the picket lines captures the courage and sacrifice demanded of women who risked reputations, health and even their freedom to gain the right to vote.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marla R. Miller, author of Betsy Ross and the Making of America</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>A Woman's Crusade </i>makes it clear that rather than the Constitution simply conferring voting rights on women, women suffrage activists chiseled their demand into the Constitution through a strategic, relentless, and sometimes personally painful campaign.

Ritchie, author of Our Constitution</i></p><p>&#x201c;Nearly a half century before Martin Luther King brought Ghandian methods to bear on racial segregation, Alice Paul used non-violent protest to win full voting rights for American women; but few Americans know about her.

America's understanding of its history will be all the richer for it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Gene Roberts, The Race Beat, 2007 Pulitzer Prize winner for History</i></p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps more than any other person, Alice Paul was responsible for U.S. women finally securing the right to vote in 1920--and yet most Americans have never heard of her. It's astonishing that an individual of such courage and accomplishment would have to be "rescued" from obscurity, but that's precisely what Mary Walton has done with this dynamic and entertaining biography. Walton sweeps the reader along in Alice Paul's seven-year crusade for suffrage, all the way to its nail-biting conclusion.

Why didn't racism appear in Europe before the fourteenth century, and why did it flourish as never before in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? Why did the twentieth century see institutionalized racism in its most extreme forms? Why are egalitarian societies particularly susceptible to virulent racism? What do apartheid South Africa, Nazi Germany, and the American South under Jim Crow have in common? How did the Holocaust advance civil rights in the United States?</p><p>With a rare blend of learning, economy, and cutting insight, George Fredrickson surveys the history of Western racism from its emergence in the late Middle Ages to the present. Beginning with the medieval antisemitism that put Jews beyond the pale of humanity, he traces the spread of racist thinking in the wake of European expansionism and the beginnings of the African slave trade. And he examines how the Enlightenment and nineteenth-century romantic nationalism created a new intellectual context for debates over slavery and Jewish emancipation.</p><p>Fredrickson then makes the first sustained comparison between the color-coded racism of nineteenth-century America and the antisemitic racism that appeared in Germany around the same time. He finds similarity enough to justify the common label but also major differences in the nature and functions of the stereotypes invoked. The book concludes with a provocative account of the rise and decline of the twentieth century's overtly racist regimes--the Jim Crow South, Nazi Germany, and apartheid South Africa--in the context of world historical developments.</p><p>This illuminating work is the first to treat racism across such a sweep of history and geography. It is distinguished not only by its original comparison of modern racism's two most significant varieties--white supremacy and antisemitism--but also by its eminent readability.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Racism: A Short History</i> is an original synthesis of the important historical writings on racial belief systems. In this clearly written book, George Fredrickson is the first scholar to systematically examine and compare the two most dominant forms of Western racism--antisemitism and white supremacy. It is an insightful work that will be widely discussed and cited by historians and social scientists alike."--<b>William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University</b></p><p>"With a master's experience, George Fredrickson has deftly laid out an apparently simple but subtle history of racial antisemitism and color-coded racial thought. In doing so, he has written a penetrating analysis that commands our close and serious attention."--<b>Winthrop D. Jordon, University of Mississippi, author of <i>White Over Black</i></b></p><p>"Finally we have a concise, clear, and authoritative overview of the history of racism. Covering all forms of Western racism in the modern world, this volume provides a comparative context for our teaching and research about race and racism. In a world in which 'race' has begun to be reintroduced in science and social science, the dangers inherent in this are revealed in George M. Fredrickson's admirable work."--<b>Sander L. Gilman, Director, The Humanities Laboratory, University of Illinois, Chicago, author of <i>Making the Body Beautiful</i></b></p><p>"Like a searchlight in the fog, this book picks out both the persistent and the changing meanings of racism as an idea and a set of practices among people of European derivation across several centuries. A compulsively readable and deeply informed overview."--<b>John Higham, The Johns Hopkins University, author of <i>Strangers in the Land</i></b></p><p>"This is comparative history at its best. The long historical perspective makes for interesting reading, and Fredrickson's analysis is very effective. While modern antisemitism is clearly one variant of race thinking, no one has attempted to compare systematically its manifestations in German history with the racial systems of South Africa and the United States. The comparison is illuminating. With its admirable brevity and lucid prose, the work should attract many readers."--<b>Eric D. Weitz, author of <i>For Race and Nation</i> (forthcoming)</b></p><p>"The dean of comparative studies of race, Fredrickson has delivered a richly informed overview of the terrible, long history of racism. His contextualization will provide the historical foundation on which future analysis of racism can and will build."--<b>Anthony William Marx, Columbia University, author of <i>Making Race and Nation</i></b></p><p>"This outstanding book marshals scholarly learning with an impressively light touch. The book's originality lies in its successful combination of comparative and historical perspectives, which enables Fredrickson to draw connections previously overlooked in the scholarly literature. It is fascinating to read and is destined to become a classic."--<b>Desmond King, author of <i>Making Americans</i></b></p><p>"Combining lucidity and erudition, Fredrickson cogently situates contemporary racism as a legacy of modernity and of the rise of Europe. He sweeps away numerous misconceptions to develop a largely convincing overview of racism's resilience and menace, as well as its links to antisemitism. Every student of racism, every antiracist activist, will benefit from reading this crucial book."--<b>Howard Winant, Temple University, author of <i>The World is a Ghetto</i></b></p><p>"In this powerful book, George Fredrickson explores the history of racism, from its religious origins in fifteenth-century Spain, through its complex association with the Enlightenment, to its brutalizing influence on twentieth-century America, Germany, and South Africa. Few scholars could even attempt such a sweeping study, and none can match the erudition, analytic clarity, and sound judgment that Fr</p><b>George M. Fredrickson</b> is Edgar E.

Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots offers students and other interested readers an overview of the technology of mobility -- the mechanisms that allow a mobile robot to move through a real world environment to perform its tasks -- including locomotion, sensing, localization, and motion planning. It discusses all facets of mobile robotics, including hardware design, wheel design, kinematics analysis, sensors and perception, localization, mapping, and robot control architectures.The design of any successful robot involves the integration of many different disciplines, among them kinematics, signal analysis, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory. Reflecting this, the book presents the techniques and technology that enable mobility in a series of interacting modules. Each chapter covers a different aspect of mobility, as the book moves from low-level to high-level details. The first two chapters explore low-level locomotory ability, examining robots' wheels and legs and the principles of kinematics. This is followed by an in-depth view of perception, including descriptions of many "off-the-shelf" sensors and an analysis of the interpretation of sensed data. The final two chapters consider the higher-level challenges of localization and cognition, discussing successful localization strategies, autonomous mapping, and navigation competence. Bringing together all aspects of mobile robotics into one volume, Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots can serve as a textbook for coursework or a working tool for beginners in the field.</p></p><p>&#34;This book is easy to read and well organized. The idea of providing a robot functional architecture as an outline of the book, and then explaining each component in a chapter, is excellent. I think the authors have achieved their goals, and that both the beginner and the advanced student will have a clear idea of how a robot can be endowed with mobility.&#34; --Raja Chatila, LAAS - CNRS, FranceIllah R.

The author&#39;s only romance, the novel concerns Bruno Bicek, a would-be boxer from Chicago&#39;s Northwest side, and Steffi, the woman who shares his dream while living his nightmare. &#34;It is an unusual and brilliant book,&#34; said The New York Times. &#34;A bold scribbling upon the wall for comfortable Americans to ponder and digest.&#34; This new edition features an introduction by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. and an interview with Nelson Algren by H.E.F.

Algren&#x2019;s powerful voice rose from the urban wilderness of postwar Chicago, and it is to that city of hustlers, addicts and scamps that he returned again and again, eventually raising Chicago&#x2019;s &#x201c;lower depths&#x201d; up onto a stage for the whole world to behold. Recipient of the first National Book Award for fiction and lauded by Hemingway as &#x201c;one of the two best authors in America,&#x201d; Algren remains among our most defiant and enduring novelists. His work includes five major novels, two short fiction collections, a book-length poem and several collections of reportage. A source of inspiration to artists as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut and Donald Barthelme, Studs Terkel and Lou Reed, Algren died on May 9, 1981, within days of his appointment as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p>An unusual book and a brilliant book. --New York Times<br><br>The best book to come out of Chicago. --Ernest Hemingway --.<br><br>An unusual book and a brilliant book. --New York Times</p><h2>The Complete Guide to Natural Healing</h2><p>Provides natural remedies and treatments for more than 120 different illnesses, complete with detailed information on dieting, proper nutrition, homeopathy, bodywork, exercise, herbal remedies, and more.

Although Indian scholars reject this European reconstruction of their country's history, Western scholarship gives little heed to their argument. In this book, Edwin Bryant explores the nature and origins of this fascinating debate.<br></p><p>Edwin Bryant is at Harvard University.<br>"A balanced description and evaluation of the two century old debate dealing with the origins of the Indo-Aryan speaking peoples of South Asia. [Bryant] presents both sides of the issue, that is the traditional western, linguistic, and philological consensus of immigration from Central Asia, and the more recent Indian position that denies any immigration and that asserts an indigenous South Asian origin. He probes for loopholes on both sides of the argument and presents the multi-faceted evidence from linguistics, archaeology, texts, etc. in an even-handed manner. As such, the book not only is an important and very welcome introduction into recent Indian historical thought but also a valuable heuristic tool in re-evaluating many of the unspoken or un-reflected presuppositions on both sides."--Michael Witzel, Harvard University<p></p><br>"The problem of Indo-Aryan origins has vexed scholars in both India and the West for well over a century and has touched every nerve of both academic and political discourse, so much so that many in the West have automatically dismissed any arguments to come 'out of India'[this book] investigates how these two worlds of scholarship came into being and systematically exposes the logical weaknesses of most of the arguments that support the consensus f either side. This is not only an important work in the field of Indo-Aryan studies but a long overdue challenge for scholarly fair play."--J.P. Mallory, Queen's University of Belfast<p></p><br>". . . [A] groundbreaking book. . . . [Bryant] does an extraordinary job of showing the ambiguity and uncertainty of both linguistic and archeological evidence for either a migration of indigenous presence of 'Aryans' in India (little has been convincingly proved or disproved). . . .

Known for his theories of personality and political insight, Fromm dissected the sadomasochistic appeal of brutal dictators while also eloquently championing love&#x2015;which, he insisted, was nothing if it did not involve joyful contact with others and humanity at large. Admired all over the world, Fromm continues to inspire with his message of universal brotherhood and quest for lasting peace.<br><br>The first systematic study of Fromm's influences and achievements, this biography revisits the thinker's most important works, especially <i>Escape from Freedom</i> and <i>The Art of Loving</i>, which conveyed important and complex ideas to millions of readers. The volume recounts Fromm's political activism as a founder and major funder of Amnesty International, the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, and other peace groups. Consulting rare archival materials across the globe, Lawrence J. Friedman reveals Fromm's support for anti-Stalinist democratic movements in Central and Eastern Europe and his efforts to revitalize American democracy. For the first time, readers learn about Fromm's direct contact with high officials in the American government on matters of war and peace while accessing a deeper understanding of his conceptual differences with Freud, his rapport with Neo-Freudians like Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan, and his association with innovative artists, public intellectuals, and world leaders. Friedman elucidates Fromm's key intellectual contributions, especially his innovative concept of "social character," in which social institutions and practices shape the inner psyche, and he clarifies Fromm's conception of love as an acquired skill. Taking full stock of the thinker's historical and global accomplishments, Friedman portrays a man of immense authenticity and spirituality who made life in the twentieth century more humane than it might have been.</p><p>Erich Fromm was a political activist, psychologist, psychoanalyst, philosopher, and one of the most important intellectuals of the twentieth century.

In Part Two the prose texts selected are those traditionally chosen by teachers precisely because they offer the best introduction to the literature and culture of the period. The verse texts, which with the exception of four extracts from Beowulf are all complete, show something of the range that Old English poetry offers in mood, intensity of feeling, humour, and natural observation. The texts are accompanied by full explanatory notes at the foot of the page and a detailed glossary.</p> <p>Although most readers of <i>A Guide to Old English</i> will be undergraduate and graduate students, the book has been written so that it can be used by those working on their own who wish simply to gain a greater understanding and enjoyment of the language and literature of the Anglo-Saxons.</p></p><p><b>Bruce Mitchell</b> is Fellow Emeritus of St. Edmund Hall, Oxford. <p><b>Fred C.

It is a vast work, necessarily more suited to the scholar and research worker than the general reader. This paperback version, abridged and re-written by Colin Ronan, makes this extremely important study accessible to a wider public. The present book covers the material treated in volumes I and II of Dr Needham&#39;s original work. The reader is introduced to the country of China, its history, geography and language, and an account is given of how scientific knowledge travelled between China and Europe. The major part of the book is then devoted to the history of scientific thought in China itself. Beginning with ancient times, it describes the milieu in which arose the schools of the Confucians, Taoists, Mohists, Logicians and Legalists. We are thus brought on to the fundamental ideas which dominated scientific thinking in the Chinese Middle Ages, to the doctrines of the Two Forces (Yin and Yang) and the Five Elements (wu hsing), to the impact of the sceptical tradition and Buddhist and Neo-Confucian thought.</p><p></p><h2>Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web</h2><p><b>Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web</b>, Second Edition introduces the core concepts of information architecture: organizing web site content so that it can be found, designing website interaction so that it's pleasant to use, and creating an interface that is easy to understand.

Beginning with the inauguration of the republic in 1902 and addressing Castro's triumphant entry into Santiago de Cuba in 1959, <em>The Cuban Revolution</em> highlights the factors which made Cuba susceptible to revolution, including its one-crop (sugar) economy and U.S. interference in Cuban affairs. While identifying nationalism and the struggle for social justice as the legitimate forces behind the revolution, P�rez-Stable also provides insight into the problems facing Castro's Cuba. Arguing that the revolution actually ended in 1970, she blames its defeat on the regime's profitable yet doomed dependence on the Soviet Union. She further charges that Cuba's leaders failed to diversify the country's economy, to sustain development, or to create democratic institutions.<br>Now in its second edition, <em>The Cuban Revolution</em> has been updated to include an entirely new chapter on the changes affecting Cuba's policies and economy since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the failure of communism in general. The second edition also includes a new preface, an up-to-date bibliography, and a thoroughly revised concluding chapter summing up the prospects and possibilities of Cuba's future in the twenty-first century. Ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in Latin American history and politics, <em>The Cuban Revolution</em> offers students fresh insights into the successes and failures of the Cuban Revolution.</p><p>Marifeli Perez-Stable is at SUNY College at Old Westbury."An excellent and intellectually honest appraisal of how and why the socialist dream collapsed in Cuba, laying responsibility where it belongs: at the feet of the Cuban government."--Juan M. del Aguila, Emory University<br><br>Praise for the previous edition:<br><br>"This is by far the best work I have read on contemporary Cuba. It is a competent study that strives for -- and achieves -- remarkable impartiality. The Cuban Revolution conveys the probing intelligence and profound thoughtfulness that produces permanence. It is a work no just for a single<br>season but for a very long time." --Franklin W. Knight, The John Hopkins University<br><br>"What we have in The Cuban Revolution is the most complete, sustained intellectual effort to do with the Cuban revolution what dozens of authors have done for the Mexican -- to indicate the native roots of the rebellion and, most importantly, to demonstrate how these roots were of primordial<br>significance in determining the evolution of the revolution over the course of nearly haft a century. This is no small achievement, and it establishes Perez-Stable as a major voice in the study of Latin American politics and society." --Lars Schoultz, University of North Carolina</p><h2>The Discovery of Society</h2><p>In this now classic text, Collins and Makowsky explore the lives and ideas of the social thinkers who have shaped and continue to forge traditions in sociology. Focusing on the great names in the field, they weave biographical and conceptual details into a tapestry of the history of social thought of the 19th and 20th centuries. Written in a narrative style that is accessible, engaging, and exciting, this book is an excellent supplement for courses in social/sociological theory, the history of social thought, the history of sociology, and introduction to sociology.</p><p>Randall Collins is Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Riverside.

They quickly took steps against those whom they wanted to isolate, deport, or destroy. In these essays informed by the latest research, leading scholars offer rich histories of the people branded as "social outsiders" in Nazi Germany: Communists, Jews, "Gypsies," foreign workers, prostitutes, criminals, homosexuals, and the homeless, unemployed, and chronically ill. Although many works have concentrated exclusively on the relationship between Jews and the Third Reich, this collection also includes often-overlooked victims of Nazism while reintegrating the Holocaust into its wider social context.</p><br><p> The Nazis knew what attitudes and values they shared with many other Germans, and most of their targets were individuals and groups long regarded as outsiders, nuisances, or "problem cases." The identification, the treatment, and even the pace of their persecution of political opponents and social outsiders illustrated that the Nazis attuned their law-and-order policies to German society, history, and traditions.

Together the contributions debate the motivations behind the purges. For example, was the persecution of Jews the direct result of intense, widespread anti-Semitism, or was it part of a more encompassing and arbitrary persecution of "unwanted populations" that intensified with the war?

Where have they all come from? Why do we now have different vocabularies for various activities?In A History of English Words, Geoffrey Hughes answers these questions in a comprehensive study of the evolution of English vocabulary which covers words as diverse as anti-disestablishmentarianism to OK, and runagate to Monicagate. His arguments are supported and illuminated through use of numerous maps, word-fields and facsimiles of texts.This book traces the remarkable reconfigurations that the stock of English words has undergone in the past millennium. From its origins as a pure Germanic language, it acquired in the medieval period a double-layered structure as Norman-French became the &#39;upstairs&#39; language of power and Anglo-Saxon that of the populace. Subsequent influxes from Latin and Greek in the Renaissance added a third layer, so that every semantic area of the language now has three terms from these sources, as in ask, question and interrogate.The vocabulary is studied as an indicator of social change and as a symbol reflecting different social dynamics between speech communities, on models of dominance, cohabitation, colonialism and globalization. Sections are devoted to the lexical interchange of imperialism, the effects of America&#39;s global dominance on the core groups of the words we use, and politically correct language..<b>Geoffrey Hughes</b> is Professor of the History of the English Language at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Exhilarating to some and deeply troubling to others, the student protests paralyzed the university, grabbed the world&#x2019;s attention, and inspired other uprisings. Fifty years after the events, <i>A Time to Stir</i> captures the reflections of those who participated in and witnessed the Columbia rebellion.<br><br>With more than sixty essays from members of the Columbia chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, the Students&#x2019; Afro-American Society, faculty, undergraduates who opposed the protests, &#x201c;outside agitators,&#x201d; and members of the New York Police Department, <i>A Time to Stir</i> sheds light on the politics, passions, and ideals of the 1960s. Moving beyond accounts from the student movement&#x2019;s white leadership, this book presents the perspectives of black students, who were grappling with their uneasy integration into a supposedly liberal campus, as well as the views of women, who began to question their second-class status within the protest movement and society at large. <i>A Time to Stir</i> also speaks to the complicated legacy of the uprising. For many, the events at Columbia inspired a lifelong dedication to social causes, while for others they signaled the beginning of the chaos that would soon engulf the left. Taken together, these reflections present a nuanced and moving portrait that reflects the sense of possibility and excess that characterized the 1960s.</p><p>Paul Cronin&#x2019;s books include <i>Werner Herzog</i>: <i>A Guide for the Perplexed</i> (2014) and <i>Lessons with Kiarostami </i>(2015).

(Todd Gitlin, author of <i>The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage</i>)<br><br>In this richly contextualized collection of essays written by participants involved in the student protests at Columbia University in the spring of 1968, historian Paul Cronin treats the topic as comprehensively as possible. <i>A Time to Stir</i> showcases a broad range of perspectives, draws out numerous themes, and reminds us why the Columbia rebellion remains relevant today. <i>A Time to Stir</i> also makes for dramatic, exciting, and provocative reading. This is can't-put-it-down history. (John McMillian, Georgia State University)<br><br><i>A Time to Stir </i>creates an extraordinary, fair-minded portrait of Columbia '68 and the effect it had on many of its participants. The myth is still out there of elite '60s-era student protesters leaving behind their radical youths soon after graduation.

(David Farber, University of Kansas)<br><br>By collecting and arranging the testimonies of the historical actors who participated in perhaps the most well-known American student rebellion in the post-WWII era, <i>A Time to Stir</i> has issued a favor to future researchers.

Seymour Slive focuses on the major artists of the period, analyzing works by Hals, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others. He discusses the kinds of painting that became Dutch specialties&#x2015;portraits, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes, Italianate pictures, architectural painting, and still lifes&#x2015;as well as traditional biblical and historical subjects painted by artists of the period. He also examines patronage and trends of art theory, criticism, and collecting. This book replaces the classic section on painting in<i> Dutch Art and Architecture: 1600-1800</i>, jointly written by Slive and Jakob Rosenberg in the 1960s. Slive has completely rewritten and expanded the original text, taking into account his own and other recent scholarship on Dutch painting as well as new archival finds, technical analyses of paintings made by conservators and scientists, and significant pictures that have been discovered. The number of illustrations has doubled,&nbsp;and the result is a book that will immediately establish itself as the new standard work on this great period of painting.</p><p><b>Seymour Slive</b> is Gleason Professor of Fine Arts emeritus at Harvard University.

Friedman investigates how women patrons of architecture were essential catalysts for innovation in domestic architectural design. By looking at such iconic houses as Hollyhock House (Frank Lloyd Wright), the Truus Schr�der House (Gerrit Rietveld), the Edith Farnsworth House (Ludwig Mies van der Rohe), the Constance Perkins House (Richard Neutra), and the Vanna Venturi House (Robert Venturi), she explores the challenges that unconventional attitudes and ways of life presented to architectural thinking and to the architects themselves. Detailed portraits fashioned from personal letters, diaries, office records, photo albums, and interviews of the clients and architects reveal the private passions and struggles that women and men of talent and creativity brought to these projects, and suggest the rich cultural and artistic context in which each house was created. The works considered are thus brought to life through the people who commissioned, designed, and lived in them.</p><p>Social and architectural historian Alice T. Friedman asks the question, "Why is it that an unexpectedly large number of the most significant and original houses built in Europe and America in the 20th century--houses that stand out not only as examples of modern design but also for their innovative approaches to domestic space--were commissioned by female clients?" She answers with a penetrating look at houses created by well-known client-architect pairs, such as Sarah Stein and Le Corbusier, Edith Farnsworth and Mies van der Rohe, and more than one independent woman who irritated Frank Lloyd Wright by staying in charge of a project. Friedman writes with brilliance and depth about these pairs' shared ideals, their frequent disputes, and the monuments of modernism that resulted from their complex relationships. <i>--Margaret Moorman</i><b>Alice T.

This fifth and final volume of <em>The Oxford History of the British Empire</em> shows how opinions have changed dramatically from one generation to the next on the nature and role of imperialism generally, and the British Empire more specifically.<br> <br> In these pages, a distinguished team of scholarly contributors discuss the many and diverse elements that have influenced writings on the Empire. Topics in this vein include the pressure of current events, access to primary sources, the creation of relevant university chairs, the rise of nationalism in former colonies, decolonization, and the Cold War. The chapters aim to demonstrate how the study of empire has evolved from a narrow focus on constitutional issues to a wide-ranging, multi-faceted analysis of international relations, the uses of power, and the influences and counter-influences between settler groups and indigenous peoples. The result is a thought-provoking cultural and intellectual inquiry into our understanding of the past.<br> <em>About the Series:</em> <br> <em>The Oxford History of the British Empire</em> is a major new assessment of the Empire in the light of recent scholarship and the progressive opening of historical records. It deals with the interaction of British and non-western societies from the Elizabethan era to the late twentieth century, provides a balanced treatment of the ruled as well as the rulers, and takes into account the significance of the Empire for the peoples of the British Isles.

Towsley is the author of several books on hunting and shooting and an accomplished outdoor photographer. He is a hunting consultant and booking agent for a variety of North American game species.

Towsley makes his home in North Clarendon, Vermont.Detailed information on the techniques, tools and materials needed for successful cartridge conversion and handloading, make this new updated book from Stoeger an essential tool for any handloader. -- <i>Don Lewis, The Leader Times, September 10, 2004</i><br><br>Handloader's manual of cartridge conversions: one of those "must have" books for the reloader I don't think it is possible for a serious shooter or reloader to have too many books. My office is crowded with them. Closest at hand are those I use most often. One of those is The Handloader's Manual of Cartridge Conversions. Don't let the title fool you. While it is surely true that the book tells you how to make this cartridge case out of that one there is also a drawing and complete set of dimensions, sometimes historical information and at least one handload recipe. The 3rd edition, updated by Bryce Towsley, is now available from Stoeger Publications. It is a hardbound tome of more than 600 pages that presents a lot of information in a convenient format. The new edition shows two cartridges per page. The cartridge drawings are not actual size, but show all the dimensions keyed to a table right next to it. You quickly learn that "A" is always case length, "B" is head diameter and so on. All of these are nominal dimensions and we have to remember that there are always some tolerance spreads in brass. So if you measure a case and come up with a number a few thousandths different, it doesn't automatically indicate that anything is wrong. One piece of data that is not normally seen in conventional loading manuals is case capacity. Here it is presented both in cubic centimeters and the more familiar grains of water. This bit of information is especially handy if you are working with a new cartridge for which there is little or no published data. It's easy enough to put a piece of brass on the scale and use a medicine dropper to fill the case. Then it is a simple matter to find a known case of similar shape and size for comparison. You can then look at data for the known cartridge to select a powder to start with. As always conservatism is the rule but usually you can deduce a starting load. As you go through the book you'll probably marvel, as I did, at the number of wildcat cartridges in there. Something as small as changing the shoulder angle a degree or two creates a new cartridge. The goal of almost every wildcat is to increase the capacity of the case and our choices are limited there. The quickest method is to blow out the shoulder angle to 35-40 degrees and reduce the taper of the case body as well. That was the secret to almost all of the legendary "Ackley Improved" cartridges many of which are still popular today. -- <i>Charles E. Petty, Guns Magazine, February 2005</i><br><br>Reloads work fine, and many deer hunters use them.

He is scheduled to receive a prestigious award that evening from the country&#x2019;s president, and the following day he is supposed to start shooting for a film&#x2014;perhaps his last&#x2014;in which he plays a man who runs amok. While passing through a forest, he encounters the outcasts of the society&#x2014;homeless people and migrants&#x2014;but he keeps trudging along, traversing a suburb whose inhabitants are locked in petty but mortal conflicts, crossing a seemingly unbridgeable superhighway, and wandering into an abandoned railyard, where police, unused to pedestrians, detain him briefly on suspicion of terrorism.<br> &nbsp;<br> Things don&#x2019;t improve when he reaches the heart of the city. There he can&#x2019;t help but see the alienation characteristic of its residents and the omnipresent malign influence of electronic technology. What, then, is the &#x201c;Great Fall&#x201d;? What is this heart-wrenching, humorous, distinctively attentive narrative trying to tell us? As usual, Peter Handke, deeply introspective and powerfully critical of the world around him, leaves it to the reader to figure out.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Peter Handke</b>, born in 1942, is one of the most prolific, well-known, and respected authors writing in German today. <b>Krishna Winston</b> teaches German and environmental studies at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;You are advised to read this book, take a cane, tuck a feather onto your hat like the hero, and to follow him . . .

But what exactly does this mean in practice? At different points in history, professionals in the field have addressed housing reform, education about sex and illegal drugs, hospital and clinic care, gun violence, and even bioterrorism. But there is no agreement about how far public health efforts should go in attempting to modify behaviors seen as lifestyle choices, or whether the field's mandate extends to intervening in broader social and economic conditions. <br><br>The authors of the thirteen essays in this book attempt to understand what are, and what should be, the field's chief goals and activities. Drawing on examples that include September 11th, Hurricane Katrina, the anthrax scare, and more, contributors examine the historical evolution of the profession and show how public health is changing in the context of natural and human-made disasters and the politics that surround them.</p><p>A volume in the Critical Issues in Health and Medicine, edited by Rima D.

From creamy grits to simmering pots of beans and greens, we think we know how these classic foods should taste. Yet the southern food we eat today tastes almost nothing like the dishes our ancestors enjoyed, because the varied crops and livestock that originally defined this cuisine have largely disappeared. Now a growing movement of chefs and farmers is seeking to change that by recovering the rich flavor and diversity of southern food. At the center of that movement is historian David S. Shields, who has spent over a decade researching early American agricultural and cooking practices.&nbsp; In <i>Southern Provisions</i>, he reveals how the true ingredients of southern cooking have been all but forgotten and how the lessons of its current restoration and recultivation can be applied to other regional foodways.<br><br> Shields&#x2019;s turf is the southern Lowcountry, from the peanut patches of Wilmington, North Carolina to the sugarcane fields of the Georgia Sea Islands and the citrus groves of Amelia Island, Florida. He takes us on a historical excursion to this region, drawing connections among plants, farms, growers, seed brokers, vendors, cooks, and consumers over time. Shields begins by looking at how professional chefs during the nineteenth century set standards of taste that elevated southern cooking to the level of cuisine. He then turns to the role of food markets in creating demand for ingredients and enabling conversation between producers and preparers. Next, his focus shifts to the field, showing how the key ingredients&#x2014;rice, sugarcane, sorghum, benne, cottonseed, peanuts, and citrus&#x2014;emerged and went on to play a significant role in commerce and consumption. Shields concludes with a look at the challenges of reclaiming both farming and cooking traditions.<br><br> From Carolina Gold rice to white flint corn, the ingredients of authentic southern cooking are returning to fields and dinner plates, and with Shields as our guide, we can satisfy our hunger both for the most flavorful regional dishes and their history.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>David S. Shields</b> is the Carolina Distinguished Professor and the McClintock Professor of Southern Letters at the University of South Carolina and chairman of the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation. He has been the recipient of the Southern Foodways Alliance&#x2019;s Ruth Fertel Keeper of the Flame Award, and his other books include <i>Still</i>: <i>American Silent Motion Picture Photography</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;People are always asking me what the most important book written &nbsp;about southern food is. You are holding it in your hands.&#x201d; (Sean Brock, executive chef, Husk)<br><br>&#x201c;An impassioned history of the relationship between professional cooking, markets and planting in the American South which argues that true regionality is to be found not in dishes, but in ingredients. . . . Shields, refreshingly, sees taste as an end in itself. He insists that he does not want simply to revive tradition, but provision today&#x2019;s chefs with the quality ingredients enjoyed by their predecessors.&#x201d; (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This deeply enjoyable, rambling volume has as many digressions as a country lane.&nbsp; In it, Shields stews over &#x2018;amnesia-cleansed&#x2019; cultural memory with a sense of humor and historiography.&nbsp; He mines 19th-century agricultural journals, a miscellany of famous eateries from New Orleans to Baltimore, and personal field experiences in an attempt to resuscitate a cuisine and revivify its soil.&nbsp; The writing is at times gorgeous. . . . Savor this volume, explore its many flavors, and learn that there is more to cuisine than just sitting down at the table.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;What does it take to imbue scholarly (and long-term) research with a compelling narrative? Ask University of South Carolina professor and author Shields, who combines his obvious affection for southern cuisine&#x2014;and its roots&#x2014;with a desire to present all cooking of the South, from the Appalachians to Texas, eyeing three factors: home and professional cooking, selling, and planting. His stories come alive with real people. Meet Sally Seymour, a free black pastry cook in Charleston; Colonel F. Dancy, who pioneered new ways of growing citrus; and South Carolina governor James Henry Hammond, responsible for the care and feeding of sorghum in the 1850s and its transformation into a sugar crop. Almost every chapter features at least one historical personage as well as colorful accounts of nineteenth-century feasts and unusual recipes (for instance, snipe � la Creole).&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Shields new book, <i>Southern Provisions</i>, is as much manifesto as history, and it represents a solid cornerstone in the burgeoning effort to rediscover, recognize, and adapt the preindustrial agriculture of the South, particularly the Lowcountry region, into the modern culinary lexicon. . . . Shields' contribution to the effort should be viewed as the first edition in a line of investigations that give cooks and farmers an exploratory window into an alternative world, where flavor matters and emergent cuisine expresses an adaptation of heritage that best captures the people and place in which it perennially resides.&#x201d; (<i>Charleston City Paper</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;There are loads of delicious staple produce and grain that were once essential to eating in the South that are now extinct&#x2014;or severely endangered. That&#x2019;s why professor <b>Shields</b> is trying to revive the best-tasting produce and grains from Southern history and bring them back to life (and our dinner tables).&#x201d; (<i>Bon Appetit</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Southern Provisions </i>is history as culinary restoration, and its primary message is this: To restore the tastes of the Lowcountry, one must restore the plants (and animals). . . . It takes joint effort to restore a regional food scene, but the rewards&#x2014;tastier food, healthier land, and the perpetuation of community&#x2014;are a lot more nourishing than just a meal.&#x201d; (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not often that a book comes out that is truly groundbreaking in the well-trodden fields of Southern cuisine. This spring, however, David Shields and University of Chicago Press released one of the most important books not just in Southern cuisine, but more importantly, American cuisine at large. For us at Big Jones, this is exactly the type of work that enables us to make food that is true to its Southern roots, and restores the tastes that made Southern cuisine one of the best regional cuisines in the world. . . . Big Jones owes as much of its reputation to the work Shields has done, largely behind the scenes, to bring Southern food&#x2019;s best historic qualities to the fore, as it does anyone else. . . . This is essential reading for anyone interested in culinary history, seed saving, and the evolution and future of American foodways.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Paul Fehribach, co-owner and executive chef, Big Jones)<br><br>&#x201c;Shields is an unsurpassed custodian of Southern culinary history. In&nbsp;<i>Southern Provisions,&nbsp;</i>he provides a richly detailed account of the evolution of Southern food culture, from field to marketplace to home kitchen. It&#x2019;s at once enlightening and inspiring&#x2015;a powerful call to remember and rehabilitate&nbsp;our nation&#x2019;s most essential foodways.&#x201d; (Dan Barber, co-owner and executive chef of Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns)<br><br>&#x201c;Shields makes it clear that he is not interested in the mythology of Southern food, but purely in the facts and what we can discern from them. This emphasis on the verifiable underscores the imperative to understand and acknowledge the real who and what of the region's complicated edible past. It likewise fuels the urgency to identify and preserve for the future that which is valuable and irreplaceable. <i>Southern Provisions</i> is an essential volume for anyone interested in the state of <i>American </i>food.&#x201d; (Ronni Lundy, author of Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes, and Honest Fried Chicken)</p><h2>Finite Mathematics (8th Edition)</h2><p>Widely known for incorporating interesting, relevant, and realistic applications, this text offers many real applications citing current data sources.

Condemned as dangerous leviathans in the century's first decades, by 1945 major corporations had become respected, even revered, institutions. Roland Marchand's lavishly illustrated and carefully researched book tells how large companies such as AT&amp;T and U.S. Steel created their own "souls" in order to reassure consumers and politicians that bigness posed no threat to democracy or American values.<br><br>Marchand traces this important transformation in the culture of capitalism by offering a series of case studies of such corporate giants as General Motors, General Electric, Metropolitan Life Insurance, and Du Pont Chemicals. Marchand examines the rhetorical and visual imagery developed by corporate leaders to win public approval and build their own internal corporate culture. In the "golden era" of the 1920s, companies boasted of their business statesmanship, but in the Depression years many of them turned in desperation to forms of public relations that strongly defended the capitalist system. During World War II public relations gained new prominence within corporate management as major companies linked themselves with Main-Street, small-town America. By the war's end, the corporation's image as a "good neighbor" had largely replaced that of the "soulless giant." American big business had succeeded in wrapping increasingly complex economic relationships in the comforting aura of familiarity.<br><br>Marchand, author of the widely acclaimed <i>Advertising the American Dream</i> (1985), provides an elegant and convincing account of the origins and effects of the corporate imagery so ubiquitous in our world today.</p><p>Around the turn of the century--long before corporations cared about such things as public image--society cowered beneath the lengthy shadows cast by monster companies. The soulless corporation, ensconced in monolithic skyscrapers and populated by army-sized staffs, was defended by smug men like J.P. Morgan, who believed he owed "the public nothing." One depression and a world war later, corporations began to realize the value of connecting with Main Street, small-town America. By recasting themselves as "good neighbors," businesses such as AT&amp;T and U.S. Steel proved to consumers that they posed no threat to democracy or the American way. Roland Marchand's <i>Creating the Corporate Soul</i> provides a brilliant look at this transformation, showing how spin doctors gave these callous giants a thorough makeover. Filled with entertaining print ads and interesting case studies, the book shows us the power of public relations and corporate image. Marchand's exhaustive study may even prompt readers to take another look at modern corporations and ask them to reconsider what lies beneath their facades."Marchand's masterful study of the creation of the corporate image is a classic, to be put alongside his <i>Advertising the American Dream.</i> It will be essential reading for anyone interested in business, technology, consumer culture, and advertising in the twentieth century."&#x2014;Jeffrey L. Meikle, University of Texas at Austin<br><br>"More than any other historian, Roland Marchand has illuminated the murky crannies of our nation's underculture, in the process showing us how much of our national mythology is both reflected in and created by such once-scorned arts as advertising and public relations. <i>Creating the Corporate Soul</i> is a magisterial baring of the American psyche fashioned by the grandfathers and godfathers of today's spin doctors. It ranks with such great business histories as Daniel Boorstin's <i>The Americans: The Democratic Experience</i> and Alfred Chandler's <i>The Visible Hand."</i>&#x2014;Randall Rothenberg, author of <i>Where the Suckers Moon: An Advertising Story</i></p><h2>Italomodern 1: Architecture in Northern Italy 1946-1976</h2><p>&nbsp;Vienna-based architect Martin Feiersinger and his brother, artist and photographer Werner Feiersinger have extensively travelled across Northern Italy in order to document the region&#x2019;s modern architecture after World War II. <i>Italomodern 1 </i>and <i>2 </i>is the result of their travels, the most authoritative survey of Northern Italy&#x2019;s architecture between 1946 and 1976.&nbsp; In their study, they have focused exclusively on distinctive buildings rather than entire urban structures, and they have selected the projects included as exemplary representations of neorealism, rationalism, brutalism, and organic.<br><br><i>Italomodern 1</i> features 84 buildings and <i>Italomodern 2</i> contains an additional 132 buildings.

William H. Worger, American Journal of Sociology<br><br>"...Damousi's analysis of convict childhood and the ways that orphans could register their dissent from controls through gossiping and sulking is excellent.

It is also claimed that GM crops offer higher yields and better nutrition, that they are safe for health and the environment, that they reduce agrochemical use, and that they are needed to feed the world&#x2019;s growing population. This book, co-authored by two genetic engineers and a writer/researcher, exposes these claims as false, using scientific and other documented evidence. GMO Myths and Truths summarizes the facts on the safety and efficacy of genetically modified (GM) crops and foods in terms that are accessible to the non-scientist but still relevant to scientists, policymakers and educators. The evidence presented points to many hazards, risks, and limitations of genetic engineering technology. These include harms found in animal feeding and ecological studies, which in turn indicate risks to health and the environment posed by GM crops and foods.</p> <p>The layout of the book enables those readers with limited time to read the chapter summaries, while providing more detail and full references for those who require them. At 164 pages of paperback size, this new condensed version is shorter and more accessible than the authors&#x2019; 330-page report by the same name, which has been downloaded over half a million times.</p> <p>The book shows that conventional breeding continues to outstrip GM in developing crops that deliver high yields, better nutrition, and tolerance to extreme weather conditions and poor soils. In agreement with over 400 international experts who co-authored a UN and World Bank-sponsored report on the future of farming, the authors conclude that modern agroecology, rather than GM, is the best path for feeding the world&#x2019;s current and future populations in a safe and sustainable way.</p></p><p><p>Claire Robinson, MPhil is editor at GMWatch, a public news and information service on genetically modified (GM) foods and crops and their associated pesticides.</p><br><br><p>Michael Antoniou, PhD is a Reader in Molecular Genetics and Head of the Gene Expression and Therapy Group, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King&#x2019;s College London School of Medicine, UK.

But this is wrong. There is plenty of sound empirical evidence of such harm, presented by qualified scientists in peer-reviewed literature. This book is a succinct summary and documentation of that evidence.&#x201d;<strong>--Richard Jennings, PhD, Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, UK</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>GMO Myths and Truths </em>is a very important contribution to the GMO debate. Written in a clear and concise style, it is an invaluable reference for those wanting to learn more about the arguments of proponents and those critical of the technology. I found it of great value in my own efforts to better understand the issue. I hope this information will be widely available to students and to the general public.&#x201d;<strong>--Jane Goodall, PhD, DBE, and UN Messenger of Peace</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Using peer-reviewed studies and other documented evidence, <em>GMO Myths and Truths </em>deconstructs the false and misleading claims that are frequently made about the safety and efficacy of GM crops and foods. The book shows that far from being necessary to feed the world, GM crops are a risky distraction from the real causes of hunger. What is more, there is no reason to take this risk, since GM crops do not consistently raise yields, reduce pesticide use, or provide more nutritious food. GM crops and foods have not been shown to be safe to eat &#x2013; and both animal feeding studies and non-animal laboratory experiments indicate that some GM foods, as well as most of the chemicals required to produce them, are toxic. Fortunately, the book shows that there are effective and sustainable alternatives to GM that can ensure a safe and plentiful food supply for current and future populations. <em>GMO Myths and Truths </em>is an invaluable and easy-to-read resource for everyone, including students, scientists, and members of the general public.&#x201d;<strong>--David Schubert, PhD, Professor and Director, Cellular Neurobiology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Genetic engineering and its applications in agriculture are complex topics, even for scientists that are engaged with them. The range of techniques is large, as is the range of their implications for different groups in society,&nbsp; from the farmer, through to the citizen, to the corporation. It is difficult sometimes to have the latest information at the end of the fingertips and to understand the difference in how the same evidence is framed depending on the interests behind the science. <em>GMO Myths and Truths </em>is a great resource for me. It is written in a form that makes it readable to non-experts without losing value for the expert looking for the latest references.

The rapid demise of children&#x2019;s health where more children are chronically sick than well is statistically demonstrated in the US. The common denominator to all children&#x2019;s health is their food. We, as pediatricians, have had to become geneticists and toxicologists to understand the impact of our changing food system in our modern agroenvironment and its effect on our children&#x2019;s well-being without support from our traditional medical literary sources. Drs Antoniou and Fagan and Claire Robinson have provided a concise reference on the topic of GM foods and their impact that will educate the physician, farmer, citizen and policymaker. From this easily-readable third edition, a busy practitioner is able to extract the necessary information on the state of GM science to be utilized in their medical practice.

Wolfert has won the James Beard Award, the Julia Child Award, the M. F. K. Fisher Award, and the Tastemaker Award, and was a finalist for the Andr� Simon Award. A regular columnist for <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>, Wolfert lives in Sonoma, California. </p>In this revision of her 1977 volume of the same name, Wolfert (The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean) has replaced many of the richer dishes of that book with 75 new recipes that represent "some of the best of what the Mediterranean has to offer in terms of health as well as taste." The 150 recipes here are also less demanding, epitomizing a culinary simplicity that highlights the flavor of fresh ingredients. Organized around main ingredients rather than courses or geographical borders, the chapters sport such titles as "Garlic and Oil" and "Chick Peas, Lentils and Beans." Wolfert pays particular attention to the cooking traditions and specialties of the Italian region of Apulia, of Spain's Andalusia, of Provence, Turkey and, in particular, Tunisia. The latter, in which hot red peppers feature more emphatically than in dishes from neighboring areas, includes recipes for the characteristic spice mixture called tabil, and Gamber Sghir, grilled shrimp accompanied by a spicy tomato-based sauce. More specialized than Joyce Goldstein's Mediterranean: The Beautiful Cookbook, just out from Collins Publishers San Francisco (PW, August 29), Wolfert's revised collection will appeal to adventurous home cooks already familiar with the region's fare. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sister Carrie</h2><p>&#x201c;When a girl leaves home at eighteen, she does one of two things. Either she falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse.&#x201d; With <b>Sister Carrie</b><i>,</i> first published in 1900, Theodore Dreiser transformed the conventional &#x201c;fallen woman&#x201d; story into a genuinely innovative and powerful work of fiction. As he hurled his impressionable midwestern heroine into the throbbing, amoral world of the big city, he revealed, with brilliant insight, the deep and driving forces of American culture: the restless idealism, glamorous materialism, and basic spiritual innocence.<br><br><b>Sister Carrie</b> brought American literature into the twentieth century. This volume, which reprints the text Dreiser approved for publication during his lifetime and includes a special appendix discussing his earlier, unedited manuscript, is the original standard edition of one of the great masterpieces of literary realism.</p><p><i>Sister Carrie</i>, Theodore Dreiser's revolutionary first novel, was published in 1900--sort of. The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored "author's cut" of <i>Sister Carrie</i> that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing.<p> Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by <i>Sister Carrie</i>'s last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i></p>Theodore Dreiser had a hardscrabble youth and the years of newspaper work behind him when he began his first novel, <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the story of a beautiful Midwestern girl who makes it big in New York City. Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.</p><h2>Improving Comprehension Instruction: Rethinking Research, Theory, and Classroom Practice</h2><p>Co-published by Jossey-Bass and the International Reading Association, Improving Comprehension Instruction provides a comprehensive overview of current research, proven methods, and successful applications for designing and delivering effective comprehension instruction in K-12 classrooms across the curriculum.

Robert Whelan examines fire as an ecological agent and discusses how populations of organisms are affected by its passage. Drawing examples from several continents, the author studies the impact of fires on individual organisms, populations, and communities. He looks at the effects on ecological processes such as predator-prey, and plant-herbivore interactions, and summarizes the major aspects of ecology that are of particular importance to fire control--both protection against wildfires and fire as a management tool.

It has tempted filmmakers, and most recently animators, who have exploited its dramatic content to good effect but have inevitably lost some of the grays that make the original text so compelling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Victor Hugo's flamboyant imagination came Quasimodo, the grotesque bell ringer; La Esmeralda, the sensuous gypsy dancer; and the haunted archdeacon Claude Frollo. Hugo set his epic tale in the Paris of 1482 under Louis XI and meticulously re-created the <br>day-to-day life of its highest and lowest inhabitants. Written at a time of perennial political upheaval in France, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&nbsp;&nbsp;is the product of an emerging democratic sensibility and prefigures the teeming masterpiece Les Mis�rables, which Hugo would write thirty years later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the cathedral the centerpiece of the novel and called it Notre-Dame de Paris. (It received its popular English title at the time of its second translation in 1833.) Hugo wrote that his inspiration came from a carving of the word "fatality" in Greek that he had found in the cathedral. The inscription had been eradicated by the time the book was published, and Hugo feared that Notre-Dame's Gothic splendor might soon be lost to the contemporary fad for tearing down old buildings. Notre-Dame has survived as one of the great monuments of Paris, and Hugo's novel is a fitting celebration of it, a popular classic that is proving to be just as enduring.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Dr. Maria Montessori developed her theories and methods for educating young people more than a hundred years ago. Today, much of Dr. Montessori's empirical findings on how the childhood brain develops and works has now been proven accurate by recent neurological/ psychological studies on childhood learning. <br><br>M. Shannon Helfrich shares many experiences from her nearly 40 years as a Montessori teacher and teacher's trainer to help parents and Montessori teachers understand the factors that influence understanding and learning for children throughout their years of development. In a lay person's terms, the author explains how the brain develops and why interaction with the environment is essential at specific points in a child's development. She includes diagrams and photographs throughout the book.<br><br>The author also links Montessori's findings with the latest neuropsychological research, weaving back and forth between the centuries, making a strong case for the ongoing viability of a Montessori education in this brave new world. Helfrich offers many anecdotes from classroom experiences with children that support these findings. <br><br>In the beginning of her book, Helfrich asserts that Dr. Montessori was one of the great thinkers in the 20th century who changed the understanding of a child&#x2019;s nature regardless of race, class or culture, and ultimately, an evolved understanding of our humanness. This book confirms Dr. Montessori's pivotal role in the history of childhood education internationally.</p><p><br><i>Montessori Learning in the 21st Century </i>is a landmark commentary and parent education tool that makes Montessori education more accessible to a greater audience.<br><br>Shannon Helfrich's book is an important achievement for Montessori theory and practice because it is integrated with current neuroscientific findings. It demonstrates the validity of Montessori child psychology and methodology combined with an undeniable conclusion that Dr. Maria Montessori's century-old assumptions anticipated current brain research.<br> David J. Kahn<br>Executive Director, North American Montessori Teachers' Association<br>Many books have been written about Montessori&#x2019;s method, this one is about living<br>with it. Throughout the book, Shannon Helfrich offers many insights,<br>stories, and simple explanations about how children grow and how Montessori<br>education facilitates their development. In short, Shannon invites us to take a<br>fascinating journey, accompanying our child from birth to maturity from the perspective<br>of the Montessori philosophy.<br><br> Andr� Roberfroid<br>President<br>Association Montessori<br>Internationale (AMI)<br>This thought-provoking and informative book encourages parents to reflect how best to interact with their children, as well as understand and offer a variety of ways to assist with their development. Shannon&#x2019;s book represents her extensive knowledge and observations of how children develop, drawing on her many years of experience working with children of all ages and backgrounds. Her anecdotes are entertaining while also being insightful, and every parent new or not will gain inspiration and fresh perspectives from reading them.<br> Carmen Parker, Sydney, Australia, Montessori Teacher<br>This is a hugely needed book. It is a valuable resource for teachers and a guide for parents in understanding the factors that influence learning and development. It is full of facts, explanations for how the brain develops and why interaction with the environment is essential at specific points in development. Perhaps the author&#x2019;s ability to then link this to Dr. Montessori&#x2019;s work and feed it back to us with another level of understanding is the real genius of this book.

What they mainly want is straightforward, practical instruction on how to tackle and overcome their special difficulties. They want something they can readily understand and apply, and something that works. This book stresses practical study techniques which have been found to work. These techniques are the product of extensive trial and experiment based on accepted educational and learning theory.</p><p></p><h2>The Limits of the Criminal Sanction</h2><p>The argument of this book begins with the proposition that there are certain things we must understand about the criminal sanction before we can begin to talk sensibly about its limits. First, we need to ask some questions about the rationale of the criminal sanction. What are we trying to do by defining conduct as criminal and punishing people who commit crimes? To what extent are we justified in thinking that we can or ought to do what we are trying to do? Is it possible to construct an acceptable rationale for the criminal sanction enabling us to deal with the argument that it is itself an unethical use of social power? And if it is possible, what implications does that rationale have for the kind of conceptual creature that the criminal law is? Questions of this order make up Part I of the book, which is essentially an extended essay on the nature and justification of the criminal sanction.<br>We also need to understand, so the argument continues, the characteristic processes through which the criminal sanction operates. What do the rules of the game tell us about what the state may and may not do to apprehend, charge, convict, and dispose of persons suspected of committing crimes? Here, too, there is great controversy between two groups who have quite different views, or models, of what the criminal process is all about. There are people who see the criminal process as essentially devoted to values of efficiency in the suppression of crime. There are others who see those values as subordinate to the protection of the individual in his confrontation with the state. A severe struggle over these conflicting values has been going on in the courts of this country for the last decade or more. How that struggle is to be resolved is a second major consideration that we need to take into account before tackling the question of the limits of the criminal sanction. These problems of process are examined in Part II.<br>Part III deals directly with the central problem of defining criteria for limiting the reach of the criminal sanction. Given the constraints of rationale and process examined in Parts I and II, it argues that we have over-relied on the criminal sanction and that we had better start thinking in a systematic way about how to adjust our commitments to our capacities, both moral and operational.</p><p>"The academic fascination with Herbert Packer's two models of the criminal process has yielded an amazing thread of scholarship involving a variety of academic disciples, linking various topics, offering interesting insights on many criminal justice institutions and phenomena, and spanning more than four decades . . . That this enthusiasm and engagement persist to this day is proof that criminal justice scholarship indeed stands on the shoulders of giants." (Hadar Aviram <i><i>Law &amp; Social Inquiry</i></i>)</p><h2>The Hellfire Clubs: Sex, Satanism and Secret Societies</h2><p><p><b>The first authoritative account of the Hell-Fire Clubs, who joined them, and which notorious legends about them are true</b><br><br> The Hell-Fire Clubs scandalized eighteenth-century English society. Rumors of their orgies, recruitment of prostitutes, extensive libraries of erotica, extreme rituals, and initiation ceremonies circulated widely at the time, only to become more sensational as generations passed. This thoroughly researched book sets aside the exaggerated gossip about the secret Hell-Fire Clubs and brings to light the first accurate portrait of their membership (including John Wilkes, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Prince of Wales), beliefs, activities, and the reasons for their proliferation, first in the British Isles and later in America, possibly under the auspices of Benjamin Franklin.</p><p>Hell-Fire Clubs operated under a variety of titles, but all attracted similar members&#x2014;mainly upper-class men with abundant leisure and the desire to shock society. The book explores the social and economic context in which the clubs emerged and flourished; their various phases, which first involved violence as an assertion of masculinity, then religious blasphemy, and later sexual indulgence; and the countermovement that eventually suppressed them. Uncovering the facts behind the Hell-Fire legends, this book also opens a window on the rich contradictions of the Enlightenment period.</p></p><p><b>Evelyn Lord</b> has published widely on local history and is the author of <i>The Knights Templar in Britain</i> and <i>The Stuart Secret Army</i>. She lives in Cambridge, UK.Lord (<i>Knights Templar in Britain</i>) charts the rise and fall of the secret Hell-Fire Clubs, dispelling myths and exaggerated tales to present an accurate portrait of the upper-class male members, their activities and the events that led to club formations in Britain and America during the 18th century. The author sifts fact from fiction as she provides an entertaining catalogue of various clubs&#x2014;the Mohocks, the Medmenham Friars, the Beggar's Benison. Readers looking for sordid tales of orgies and satanic rituals may be disappointed by Lord's findings, which reveal that the clubs were more preoccupied with drinking, costumes, politics, dirty poetry and blasphemous jokes than with sacrificing virgins. However, the book is peppered with salacious tidbits, as the clubs did enjoy boxes of imported leather dildos, strippers, violent and random attacks on strangers, erotic literature and Bibles decorated with phallic symbols. This well-researched work&#x2014;which also profiles important club members and explains the demise of the clubs in the 19th century&#x2014;is a must-read for anyone interested in uncovering the truth about the legendary Hell-Fire Clubs. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He also wrote remarkable public lectures and many thousands of incisive letters, laying down his pen only in the hundredth year of his life.<br>Having risen within the American Foreign Service and been posted to various European capitals, and twice to Moscow, Kennan was called back to Washington in 1946, where he helped to inspire the Truman Doctrine and draft the Marshall Plan. Among other things, he wrote the X&#x201d; or Containment&#x201d; article for which he became, and still is, world famous (an article which he regarded as not very important and liable to misreading). John Lukacs describes the development and the essence of Kennan&#x2019;s thinking; the perhaps unavoidable misinterpretations of his advocacies; his self-imposed task as a leading realist critic during the Cold War; and the importance of his work as a historian during the second half of his long life.</p><p><b>John Lukacs</b> is an internationally read and praised historian, the author of more than twenty books, a winner of prizes, past president-elect of the American Catholic Historical Association, and member of the Royal Historical Society of the United Kingdom.The messy collision with reality that has befallen the Bush administration's freedom agenda and democracy crusade in the Middle East has meant a comeback for the foreign policy doctrine known as realism. But lest we become too enamored of unadulterated realism, with its unsentimental insistence that national interests take precedence over ideals, it's useful to study one of realism's foremost philosopher-practitioners, the Cold War diplomat and historian George Kennan. John Lukacs is the perfect writer to provide an assessment that is insightful, respectful and (less intentionally) cautionary. A distinguished historian and political philosopher in his own right, Lukacs was a friend and longtime correspondent of Kennan, who died at age 101 in 2005, and they shared an aversion to populism and a preference for rule by enlightened elites. <p>Kennan was at his best as a diplomatic observer, whose polished dispatches were clear-eyed and prescient. He relished being an outsider, but one of his cables made him the Truman administration's most influential inside strategist at the outset of the Cold War. In February 1946, when he was the No. 2 man in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, he wrote an 8,000-word missive, the "Long Telegram," outlining a strategy of Soviet containment. </p><p>Kennan went on to write an influential piece, whose author was identified only as "X," in Foreign Affairs magazine and then helped to put together the Marshall Plan to rescue war-ravaged Europe. But he soon drifted back to the sidelines of power as a pessimistic commentator, and by 1950 moved to Princeton, where he spent most of the remaining half-century of his life.</p><p>Kennan's roots as a realist thinker came from a cold view of national interests, narrowly defined, and a dark view of human nature. That made him a traditionalist and a conservative, even though his sharpest critics came from the right. In a passage that gives a revealing taste of his book, Lukacs goes so far as to paint him, admiringly, as a lonely dissenter among the worshipers of progress: "He believed that people, and especially Americans, have reached a time when they must rethink the entire idea of 'progress.' That alone may -- I shall not say it will -- qualify him as more than an intellectual, more than a conservative, more than a traditionalist: a lone voice of prophet, a conscience of his nation." </p><p>Lukacs remains sympathetic throughout this brief book, but he provides grist for those who might have qualms about Kennan's brand of realism. From his early days as a foreign service officer to his later ones as a sage in Princeton, Kennan was unabashedly dubious about democracy. He approved of authoritarian regimes and was contemptuous of America's middle class. He also disdained the role of morality, as opposed to calculated national interests, in foreign policy; he resisted allowing more Jews to immigrate to America after Hitler took power, and he was cool toward America's entry into World War II. </p><p>Others, most notably the Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis, will eventually produce fuller biographies of Kennan. Lukacs's literate, elegant and slim volume is more of an appreciation than a biography. Yet in that regard, it is both useful and timely, especially as the United States begins yet another century of trying to weave together its national interests, which Kennan understood so well, and its moral impulses, which he did not. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Teaching Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students takes a practical look at the challenges of teaching subject matter to deaf children. The book gives suggestions about what teachers can do in the classroom that will make a positive difference in how their deaf students learn. It emphasizes providing teachers with a framework to design instructions that meet the educational needs of their deaf students. <b> </b> The principles upon which instructional planning proceeds are applicable to deaf students at all grade levels; thus, the book is suitable for teachers at the elementary through high school levels. These principles are diverse but revolve around four central themes: 1) Creating authentic experiences; 2) Integrating vocabulary development; 3) Creating opportunities for self-expression; and 4) Providing deaf role models. When applicable, distinctions are made between the various instructionalroles of teachers in self-contained classrooms, resource room teachers, and itinerant teachers, as well as general education teachers who have deaf students in their classrooms. Issues relating to diversity, discipline, and disabilities are reviewed from a pragmatic perspective. Ideas are then presented about how teachers can address these issues through instruction. Finally, strategies are provided for involving the family in the education of their deaf children, including exercises for increasing family awareness of the learning challenges their deaf children face. Practical ideas about how teachers can empower parents in the learning process are featured. <b> </b> Educators of deaf and hard of hearing students. </p></p><p></p><h2>Flora of North America: Volume 24: Magnoliophyta: Commelinidae (in part): Poaceae, part 1:North of Mexico (Flora of North America, Vol. 24)</h2><p><em>Flora of North America</em> brings together for the first time ever in a concise and easy to understand format information on all of the plants growing spontaneously in North America north of Mexico. Volume 24 of <em>Flora North America</em> is one of two volumes on grasses to be published in this series (Volume 25, though it follows sequentially, was published in 2003). Together they will provide a comprehensive, authoritative, illustrated account of this important group of plants. Most of the species treated are either native to North America north of Mexico or are introduced species that are now established in the region, but there are many that do not fit into these categories. Among the additional species are several that the USDA has identified as major weed threats; and others that are known only as cultivated plants, some being cultivated for their ornamental value, others as sources for human food or animal forage. For instance, volume 24 includes such ecologically important genera as Elymus (wheatgrasses), Poa (bluegrasses), and Festuca (fescues), economically important species such as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley), Oryza (rice), and Zizania (wild rice), several ornamental species, including some bamboos, and noxious weeds such as Elymus repens (quackgrass), and Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass).<br>The volume includes identification keys, descriptions, line drawings, and ecological characteristics for each of the species; distribution maps for the native and established species; and a list of commonly encountered synonyms for the accepted names. The treatments, each of which has been extensively reviewed, are based on a combination of original observations and critical review of the literature.<br></p><p>The Editorial Committee of the Flora of North America (FNA) is responsible for the authoritative, multivolume work describing the native plants of North America.Following the first two volumes (LJ 1/94), which covered background essays and ferns, Volume 3 of the Flora covers the magnolia and hamamelid families: 128 genera and 741 species of plants. The scope of the set now has expanded to 30 planned volumes, with Volumes 3-26 to cover angiosperms, 27-29 to cover bryophytes, and Volume 30 as an index/bibliography. Libraries wanting the most complete and up-to-date scientific overview of plant families in North America will buy the complete set. For those with a special interest in magnolias, witch hazels, and related species (laurels, peppers, buttercups, barberries, poppies, elms, walnuts, mulberries, myrtle, and more), Volume 3 can stand alone, with its own taxonomic keys, index, and bibliography. This is a scientific overview of the species, not a gardening guide; identification keys, a summary of growth habitats and characteristics, genetic analysis, economic uses, and conservation status are all presented. Taxa believed to have become extinct in the past 500 years are also included. There are also a few black-and-white illustrations.

(<i>Observer</i>)</p><h2>California Desperadoes: Stories of Early Outlaws in Their Own Words</h2><p>Historic desperadoes tell their tales of holdups, shootouts and desperate flights from the law in this chronicle illustrated with many rare photographs. From the famous 1892 shootout at Young&#39;s cabin as told by Chris Evans--a murderer, train robber and fugitive--and his partner John Sontag and the hanging of the notorious Jim Stuart by San Francisco vigilantes determined to retake their city from hordes of Australian convicts, robbers, and killers to the ill-starred adventures of Tom Bell, Tiburcio Vasquez, and Charles Dorsey and the harrowing and sometimes hilarious antics of the California highwaymen stage robbers Jim Smith and Dick Fellows, readers will vicariously experience the riveting lives of another time period.</p><p><b>No Strikes and You're Out: Outlawry and Justice in Early California</b> <p>"My dear and only friend now in this country....I have been allowed the privilege to write you a few lines, as I have but a few moments to live..." </p><p>It was October 4th, 1856, and the possemen finally had Thomas J. Hodges, alias Tom Bell, squarely where they wanted him-within feet and minutes of the hangman's noose. </p><p>"...I have been most foully betrayed. Bill and John have told things that never took place. I am accused of every robbery that has been committed for the past twelve months, which is entirely false. I never committed but three highway robberies in my life..." </p><p>Among his many other depredations, Tom Bell is credited with the first attempted stage holdup in California, August 12, 1856. The story of this incident was related by Bell's fellow gang member Bill Gristy in his confession: "I was of the party in the attack on the Camptonville stage" and Gristy's words, as well as evidence of other villainies committed by Bell during his checkered career, had brought him to the grim fate he now faced. </p><p>"-but still I am to blame, and my fate is sealed. I am to die like a dog....I must come to a close, for the hounds are thirsting for my blood. Goodbye, forever." </p><p>And so the rope stretched taut and Tom Bell passed into history. But now, Bell's own words and those of fellow murderers, horse thieves, bandits and stagecoach robbers such as English Jim Stuart, Charlie Dorsey, Tiburcio Vasquez, Old Jim Smith, Dick Fellows and Chris Evans spring back to life in William B. Secrest's California Desperadoes: Stories of Early California Outlaws in Their Own Words. </p><p>By compiling first-person accounts of early California events as seen through the eyes of those actually involved and augmenting the accounts with expert and zesty narration, Secrest provides a glimpse into the real-life drama that ensued between the forces of law and order and those of frontier barbarism. </p><p>The participants, both illiterate and eloquent, heartless and humane, give voice and insight to an intriguing era. Secrest, evoking the explosions of Colts, the thundering of hooves, the clanking of prison chains and the scents of leather, horse, cordite and fear, allows his readers to experience the opportunity to judge for themselves the intricate workings of the minds of the early California badmen and the harsh, Western justice system that brought them to their ends. </p><p>These are true stories told by true desperadoes and illustrated with many rare photographs.</p></p><h2>Object Technology: A Manager&#39;s Guide</h2><p><p>"The first edition set a standard of excellence that has eluded all followers, and I have recommended it to my clients for years.

Bowles, Ph.D., Vice President Giga Information Group</p><p> "One of the most readable introductions you will find. The new edition offers vital insights into the effective use of objects in business."<br> - Chris Stone, President Object Management Group</p><p> The first edition of <i><b>Object Technology: A Manager's Guide</b></i> is widely viewed as the classic introduction to this powerful computing concept. Object technology offers increased agility, significant time-to-market reduction, and the opportunity to exploit the potential of the World Wide Web by deploying globally distributed business systems. At a time when many of the world's largest companies are making the transition to object technology, David Taylor has updated his book to address the important issues facing the growth of object technology and to provide a glimpse into the future of this evolving paradigm. In updating this seminal work, David Taylor has retained the signature conciseness and,clarity of discussion that made the first edition a best-seller.</p><p> <i><b>Object Technology: A Manager's Guide, Second Edition</b></i>, covers the key terms, emerging concepts, and useful applications of objects. Managers, salespeople, engineers, software developers-anyone interested in understanding or implementing object technology-will find this a lucid introduction to the topic.</p><p> Highlights of this new edition include:<br> </p><ul> <li>An explanation of how to use objects to create evolutionary software that rapidly adapts to changing business conditions, eliminating the need for most new application development. <br> </li><li>An introduction to Java, and an explanation of how its use of message interfaces enables a new generation of portable, mix-and-match, Internet-enabled business objects. <br> </li><li>An update on the state of object databases and extended relational databases, with guidelines for combining the two for optimal information storage.<br> </li><li>An introduction to the new generation of object engines and how they combine storage and execution capabilities for maximum software integration.<br> </li></ul><p> <br><br> 0201309947B09102001 </p></p><p>Object-oriented technology is arguably the most exciting and least understood development in software today. Given the amount of hype coming from both media and manufacturers, it's hard for corporate managers to assess its true potential. <p>This problem is of great concern to us at Servio. We see object-oriented technology as an important step toward the industrialization of software, in which programming is transformed from an arcane craft to a systematic manufacturing process. But this transformation can't take place unless senior managers understand and support it. </p><p>What the industry needs right now is a straightforward explanation of object-oriented technology at the management level, with a candid assessment of its real costs and benefits. As one of the leading innovators in object-oriented technology, Servio is in a unique position to provide that explanation. We have devoted the resources to carry out this task as a service to the industry as a whole, not to promote our own products. We believe that everyone will be better served by a clearer understanding of the transition we are about to make. </p><p>What you have in your hand, then, is our contribution to executive education - a no-nonsense explanation of the concepts and issues involved in object-oriented technology. We hope that David's clear, readable discussion will counter some of the hype surrounding this new technology and help you make more informed decisions about adopting the technology within your own company. </p><p>Servio Corporation 1420 Harbor Bay Parkway</p><p>An internationally recognized authority on object technology, <b>Dr. David A.

On one hand, it spawned social liberalism and political radicalism; on the other, it generated the social conservatism and cultural nativism that grew into the ultra-nationalism of 1937-1945.</p><p>In art, it produced an infatuation with Western modernism as well as a new exploration of traditional aesthetics. Between these dramatic polarities was a rich middle ground of cultural synthesis and symbiosis in which Western concepts of modernity and nostalgia for Japanese tradition seamlessly merged or creatively contrasted. These values are witnessed in the Art Deco style, particularly as it infused Japanese art of Taisho.</p><p>Much of the debate over Japanese cultural identity centered on the appearance and social role of women. The primary focus in this volume is the nexus of tradition and modernity manifest in popular images of women, as well as in domestic furnishings and fashions made for women.</p><p>In an introductory essay, historian Sharon Minichiello provides a broad context for these issues by sketching major domestic and international events and themes of the period. In his essay and catalogue entries, art historian Kendall Brown first examines how women were at the center of the sociocultural debate on Japanese modernity, then details how artists helped fashion various female types, including the modern girl, the traditional beauty, and a new type of hybrid woman.</p><p>The nihonga paintings, woodblock prints, textiles, and domestic artifacts discussed and illustrated here are a broad range of objects representative of mainstream Taisho visual culture, and reconstruct the styles popular from 1915 to 1935 in a celebration of Taisho- Chic.</p></p><p><p>The nihonga paintings, woodblock prints, textiles, and domestic artifacts illustrated reconstruct the styles popular in Japan from 1915 to 1931.</p><p><b>Kendall H.

They produce and reveal worlds, representing them to our senses and connecting them to our lives.

They matter for how we reflect upon and act in a shared, everyday world of finite human existence.</p> <p><i>The Poetics of Digital Media</i>&nbsp;explores the poetic work of media in digital culture.

He paints on a broad canvas&#x2015;in the context of cosmic and human evolution&#x2015;revealing Michael&#x2019;s tasks in the past, present, and future. Michael, originally the countenance of Yahweh, has transformed from a &#x201c;night spirit&#x201d; into a &#x201c;day spirit.&#x201d; As &#x201c;the Countenance of Christ,&#x201d; Michael helps us find a balance between luciferic and ahrimanic tendencies. The old dualism such as good versus evil, says Steiner, needs to be replaced by the trinity of Lucifer&#x2013;Christ&#x2013;Ahriman. Filling our hearts with the Christ impulse creates equilibrium between the luciferic influence that imbues our head and the ahrimanic influence that works in our limbs.<br><br>Steiner describes how humanity faces three dangers in the social sphere&#x2015;spiritual life could flow into the &#x201c;pit of mendacity&#x201d; ruled by Ahriman; individual rights might descend into a luciferic &#x201c;pit of selfishness&#x201d;; and economics could sink into the cultural sickness and death of the Asuras. To prevent Western culture from perishing, it will need to turn toward the contemporary &#x201c;threefold&#x201d; approach to society.<br><br>Steiner also speaks of the principle of metamorphosis in connection with evolution and devolution, as he showed in the pillar designs of the newly built Goetheanum. Architectural styles express human evolution, as we can see in Greek temples, gothic Cathedrals, the Grail temple, and the building at Dornach. Among many other themes, Rudolf Steiner addresses the problem of natural necessity and freedom and the abolition of the trichotomy of body, soul, and spirit at the 869Council of Constantinople.<br></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Loyalty 3.0: How to Revolutionize Customer and Employee Engagement with Big Data and Gamification</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> bestseller!</b></p> <p><b>The new secret to driving LOYALTY THAT PAYS</b></p> <p>Once revolutionary, loyalty programs designed to differentiate products quickly became commoditized.

As Helene's sarcastic and witty letters are responded to by the staid and proper Frank Doel of Marks &amp; Company, a relationship blossoms into a warm, charming, feisty love affair.</p><p><i>84, Charing Cross Road</i> is a charming record of bibliophilia, cultural difference, and imaginative sympathy. For 20 years, an outspoken New York writer and a rather more restrained London bookseller carried on an increasingly touching correspondence. In her first letter to Marks &amp; Co., Helene Hanff encloses a wish list, but warns, "The phrase 'antiquarian booksellers' scares me somewhat, as I equate 'antique' with expensive." Twenty days later, on October 25, 1949, a correspondent identified only as FPD let Hanff know that works by Hazlitt and Robert Louis Stevenson would be coming under separate cover. When they arrive, Hanff is ecstatic--but unsure she'll ever conquer "bilingual arithmetic." By early December 1949, Hanff is suddenly worried that the six-pound ham she's sent off to augment British rations will arrive in a kosher office. But only when FPD turns out to have an actual name, Frank Doel, does the real fun begin.<p> Two years later, Hanff is outraged that Marks &amp; Co. has dared to send an <i>abridged</i> Pepys diary. "i enclose two limp singles, i will make do with this thing till you find me a real Pepys. THEN i will rip up this ersatz book, page by page, AND WRAP THINGS IN IT." Nonetheless, her postscript asks whether they want fresh or powdered eggs for Christmas. Soon they're sharing news of Frank's family and Hanff's career. No doubt their letters would have continued, but in 1969, the firm's secretary informed her that Frank Doel had died. In the collection's penultimate entry, Helene Hanff urges a tourist friend, "If you happen to pass by 84, Charing Cross Road, kiss it for me. I owe it so much."</p>Helene Hanff is the author of APPLE OF MY EYE, THE DUCHESS OF BLOOMSBURY STREET, LETTER FROM NEW YORK, Q&#39;S LEGACY and UNDERFOOT IN SHOW BUSINESS. She wrote a number of books for young readers the best known being MOVERS AND SHAKERS and TERRIBLE THOMAS.

The rate of incorporation of new sources and methods into African historical research shows no signs of slowing. This book is both a snapshot of current academic practice and an attempt to sort through some of the problems scholars face within this unfolding web of sources and methods. The book is divided into five sections, each of which begins with a short introduction by a distinguished Africanist scholar. The first section deals with archaeological contributions to historical research. The second section examines the methodologies involved in deciphering historically accurate African ethnic identities from the records of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The third section mines old documentary sources for new historical perspectives. The fourth section deals with the method most often associated with African historians, that of drawing historical data from oral tradition. The fifth section is devoted to essays that present innovative sources and methods for African historical research. Together, the essays in this cutting-edge volume represent the current state of the art in African historical research.

Despite the publication of hundreds of textbooks in this field, each one intended to provide an improvement over previous textbooks, students of differential equations continue to remain perplexed as a result of numerous subject areas that must be remembered and correlated when solving problems. Various interpretations of differential equations terms also contribute to the difficulties of mastering the subject.<br><br>In a study of differential equations, REA found the following basic reasons underlying the inherent difficulties of differential equations:<br><br>No systematic rules of analysis were ever developed to follow in a step-by-step manner to solve typically encountered problems. This results from numerous different conditions and principles involved in a problem that leads to many possible different solution methods. To prescribe a set of rules for each of the possible variations would involve an enormous number of additional steps, making this task more burdensome than solving the problem directly due to the expectation of much trial and error.<br><br>Current textbooks normally explain a given principle in a few pages written by a differential equations professional who has insight into the subject matter not shared by others. These explanations are often written in an abstract manner that causes confusion as to the principle's use and application. Explanations then are often not sufficiently detailed or extensive enough to make the reader aware of the wide range of applications and different aspects of the principle being studied. The numerous possible variations of principles and their applications are usually not discussed, and it is left to the reader to discover this while doing exercises. Accordingly, the average student is expected to rediscover that which has long been established and practiced, but not always published or adequately explained.<br><br>The examples typically following the explanation of a topic are too few in number and too simple to enable the student to obtain a thorough grasp of the involved principles. The explanations do not provide sufficient basis to solve problems that may be assigned for homework or given on examinations.<br><br>Poorly solved examples such as these can be presented in abbreviated form which leaves out much explanatory material between steps, and as a result requires the reader to figure out the missing information. This leaves the reader with an impression that the problems and even the subject are hard to learn - completely the opposite of what an example is supposed to do.<br><br>Poor examples are often worded in a confusing or obscure way. They might not state the nature of the problem or they present a solution, which appears to have no direct relation to the problem. These problems usually offer an overly general discussion - never revealing how or what is to be solved.<br><br>Many examples do not include accompanying diagrams or graphs, denying the reader the exposure necessary for drawing good diagrams and graphs. Such practice only strengthens understanding by simplifying and organizing differential equations processes.<br><br>Students can learn the subject only by doing the exercises themselves and reviewing them in class, obtaining experience in applying the principles with their different ramifications.<br><br>In doing the exercises by themselves, students find that they are required to devote considerable more time to differential equations than to other subjects, because they are uncertain with regard to the selection and application of the theorems and principles involved. It is also often necessary for students to discover those "tricks" not revealed in their texts (or review books) that make it possible to solve problems easily. Students must usually resort to methods of trial and error to discover these "tricks," therefore finding out that they may sometimes spend several hours to solve a single problem.<br><br>When reviewing the exercises in classrooms, instructors usually request students to take turns in writing solutions on the boards and explaining them to the class. Students often find it difficult to explain in a manner that holds the interest of the class, and enables the remaining students to follow the material written on the boards. The remaining students in the class are thus too occupied with copying the material off the boards to follow the professor's explanations.<br><br>This book is intended to aid students in differential equations overcome the difficulties described by supplying detailed illustrations of the solution methods that are usually not apparent to students. Solution methods are illustrated by problems that have been selected from those most often assigned for class work and given on examinations. The problems are arranged in order of complexity to enable students to learn and understand a particular topic by reviewing the problems in sequence. The problems are illustrated with detailed, step-by-step explanations, to save the students large amounts of time that is often needed to fill in the gaps that are usually found between steps of illustrations in textbooks or review/outline books.<br><br>The staff of REA considers differential equations a subject that is best learned by allowing students to view the methods of analysis and solution techniques. This learning approach is similar to that practiced in various scientific laboratories, particularly in the medical fields.<br><br>In using this book, students may review and study the illustrated problems at their own pace; students are not limited to the time such problems receive in the classroom.<br><br>When students want to look up a particular type of problem and solution, they can readily locate it in the book by referring to the index that has been extensively prepared. It is also possible to locate a particular type of problem by glancing at just the material within the boxed portions. Each problem is numbered and surrounded by a heavy black border for speedy identification.<br></p><h2>Tudor England</h2><p>John Guy here provides the most complete narrative history of Tudor England in more than 30 years.

Scientists and animal researchers routinely warn against "animal stories," and contrast rigorous explanations and observation to facile and even fanciful projections about animals. Yet many of us, scientists and researchers included, continue to see animals as humans and humans as animals. As this innovative new collection demonstrates, humans use animals to transcend the confines of self and species; they also enlist them to symbolize, dramatize, and illuminate aspects of humans' experience and fantasy. Humans merge with animals in stories, films, philosophical speculations, and scientific treatises. In their performance with humans on many stages and in different ways, animals move us to think. <br><br>From Victorian vivisectionists to elephant conservation, from ancient Indian mythology to pet ownership in the contemporary United States, our understanding of both animals and what it means to be human has been shaped by anthropomorphic thinking. The contributors to <i>Thinking with Animals</i> explore the how and why of anthropomorphism, drawing attention to its rich and varied uses. Prominent scholars in the fields of anthropology, ethology, history, and philosophy, as well as filmmakers and photographers, take a closer look at how deeply and broadly ways of imagining animals have transformed humans and animals alike. <br><br>Essays in the book investigate the changing patterns of anthropomorphism across different time periods and settings, as well as their transformative effects, both figuratively and literally, upon animals, humans, and their interactions. Examining how anthropomorphic thinking "works" in a range of different contexts, contributors reveal the ways in which anthropomorphism turns out to be remarkably useful: it can promote good health and spirits, enlist support in political causes, sell products across boundaries of culture of and nationality, crystallize and strengthen social values, and hold up a philosophical mirror to the human predicament.</p><p>In <i>Thinking with Animals</i>, prominent scholars in the fields of anthropology, ethology, history, and philosophy, as well as filmmakers and photographers, take a closer look at how anthropomorphism has transformed humans and animals alike.

Their alternative modelling approach to conventional models introduces the notion of a functional dendritic space, and they have concentrated on a detailed spatial description of the electrical states at all dendritic sites when the dendrites operate. By analyzing the electrical dendritic space in which all the signals are processed, the authors provide tools to explore the spatial dimension of the transient events well known by electrophysiologists. They demonstrate the mechanisms by which the operating dendrites decide how, in fine, the distributed synaptic inputs generate final various output discharges. Their approach reveals the mechanisms by which individual dendritic geometry determines the sequence of action potentials that is the neuronal code. An accompanying NeuronViewer allows readers to monitor the simulation of operating dendritic arborization.</p><p>This book explains how a neuron works in terms of its functional architecture and dynamics. It provides the biophysical background and methodology for the analysis of dendritic processing with an original approach that is focussed on the role of geometry of the dendritic arborizations.

Princeton Mathematical Series</h2><p><p>Logic is sometimes called the foundation of mathematics: the logician studies the kinds of reasoning used in the individual steps of a proof. Alonzo Church was a pioneer in the field of mathematical logic, whose contributions to number theory and the theories of algorithms and computability laid the theoretical foundations of computer science. His first Princeton book, <i>The Calculi of Lambda-Conversion</i> (1941), established an invaluable tool that computer scientists still use today.</p><br><p> Even beyond the accomplishment of that book, however, his second Princeton book, <i>Introduction to Mathematical Logic</i>, defined its subject for a generation. Originally published in Princeton's Annals of Mathematics Studies series, this book was revised in 1956 and reprinted a third time, in 1996, in the Princeton Landmarks in Mathematics series. Although new results in mathematical logic have been developed and other textbooks have been published, it remains, sixty years later, a basic source for understanding formal logic.</p><br><p> Church was one of the principal founders of the Association for Symbolic Logic; he founded the <i>Journal of Symbolic Logic</i> in 1936 and remained an editor until 1979 At his death in 1995, Church was still regarded as the greatest mathematical logician in the world.</p></p><p>One of the pioneers of mathematical logic in the twentieth century was Alonzo Church. He introduced such concepts as the lambda calculus, now an essential tool of computer science, and was the founder of the Journal of Symbolic Logic. In <b>Introduction to Mathematical Logic</b>, Church presents a masterful overview of the subjectone which should be read by every researcher and student of logic. The previous edition of this book was in the Princeton Mathematical Series.This book is intended to be used as a textbook by students of mathematics, and also within limitations as a reference work. As a textbook it offers a beginning course in mathematical logic, but presupposes some substantial mathematical background.</p><h2>Complete French Grammar Review (Barron&#39;s Grammar Series)</h2><p>A brand-new title in Barron�&#x201a;'s Foreign Language Guides and the latest in the foreign language Grammar Review series, this book covers virtually every rule of French grammar and usage.

Triplet continues the saga begun in his earlier book, <i>A Youth in the Meuse-Argonne: A Memoir, 1917-1918.</i> After serving in World War I, Triplet chose to become a career military man and entered West Point. Upon graduation in 1924, his assignments were routine&#x2014;to regiments in the Southwest and in Panama or as an officer in charge of Reserve Officers' Training Corps units or of men sent to a tank school. All this changed, however, when a new war opened in Europe.</p><p>From 1940 to1942, Triplet was assigned to the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he engaged in testing new weapons and machines for the expanding army. He became a full colonel in December 1942. After leaving Benning he received posts with four armored forces: the Thirteenth Armored Division forming in the United States, an amphibious tank and troop carrier group training at Fort Ord, California, and the Second and Seventh Armored Divisions in Europe. His extraordinary abilities as a tank commander became evident in the Seventh Armored, where he took over a four-thousand-man unit known as Combat Command A. He was soon moving from triumph to triumph as he led his unit into Germany. Here was much room for professional judgment and decision, and the colonel was in his element. In the war's last days Triplet and his men fought their way to the Baltic, preventing many German troops from joining in the defense of Berlin against the advancing Soviet army.</p><p>Although Triplet was recommended for brigadier general, Dwight D. Eisenhower believed the U.S. Army had enough generals to finish the war; thus, the indomitable Triplet served out the few remaining years of his career as a colonel. After retiring in 1954, Triplet moved to Leesburg, Virginia, where he soon began to mull over his military experiences. Fascinated by the history he had witnessed, engaged by the attraction of writing about it, he recorded his memories with a combination of verve, thoughtfulness, and harsh judgments concerning ranking officers he considered incompetent&#x2014; generals not excluded.</p><p>Through his annotations, Robert H. Ferrell provides the historical context for Triplet's experiences. Well written and completely absorbing, <i>A Colonel in the Armored Divisions</i> provides readers the rare opportunity to see firsthand what a real professional in the U.S. Army thought about America's preparation for and participation in the war against Germany and Japan.</p></p><p><p>Robert H. Ferrell (1921-2018) is the author or editor of numerous books, including<i> Presidential Leadership: From Woodrow Wilson to Harry S. Truman,</i><i>Harry S. Truman: A Life,</i> and<i> Five Days in October: The Lost Battalion of World War I, </i>available from the University of Missouri Press.</p>In late 1944, Colonel Triplet reached the European theater, where he headed the Army's Seventh Armored Division Combat Commands, advancing through Belgium and across Germany to the Baltic by V-E day. Triplet subsequently wrote extensive memoirs, which found their way to the archives of the U.S. Military History Institute at Carlisle, Pa. After Triplet's death, these writings were found by Ferrell, Professor Emeritus of history at Indiana University, who has done a skillful job of preparing them for publication here. The book follows last year's Ferrell-edited volume covering Triplet's WWI service as a teenage enlistee, A Youth in the Meuse-Argonne: A Memoir of World War I, 1917-1918 (Forecasts, Aug. 7, 2000). Triplet was assigned stateside for much of his second conflict , contributing to equipment development, to logistics with an ill-fated division and to troop training before heading to Europe. His appraisals of the wartime armored units and personnel are frank and realistic rather than flattering. He comes across as an exceptionally earnest, talented, admittedly headstrong soldier and an honest reporter. His attitudes on some matters risk offense by today's standards (not feeling compassion for POWs, for example), but the legacy of this memoir lies in the detailed, unusually conscientious expression of the individual officer's perspective which is to say., this book is mostly for buffs and scholars.

It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun. "The idea of falling like heroes on ceremonial battlefields," Ford Madox Ford remarked later, "was gone forever."

Samuel Bowles answers with a resounding &#x201c;no.&#x201d; Policies that follow from this paradigm, he shows, may &#x201c;crowd out&#x201d; ethical and generous motives and thus backfire.<br> &nbsp;<br> But incentives per se are not really the culprit. Bowles shows that crowding out occurs when the message conveyed by fines and rewards is that self-interest is expected, that the employer thinks the workforce is lazy, or that the citizen cannot otherwise be trusted to contribute to the public good. Using historical and recent case studies as well as behavioral experiments, Bowles shows how well-designed incentives can crowd <i>in</i> the civic motives on which good governance depends.</p><p><b>Samuel Bowles</b> directs the Behavioral Sciences Program at the Santa Fe Institute and is the author of <i>Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution</i><i>; <i>A Cooperative Species: Human Reciprocity and Its Evolution </i></i>(with Herbert Gintis);<i></i>and<i><i>The New Economics of Inequality and Redistribution</i>.</i>"In his tightly argued and illuminating book, Bowles makes the case that appeals made to our self-interest can undercut instinctive moral impulses; and that when these impulses are weakened crucial institutions work sub-optimally, if not at all."&#x2014;Robert Armstrong, <i>Financial Times</i><br>"Bowles has written a thought-provoking book, full of insights and evidence."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br>"Fascinating and thought-provoking."&#x2014;<i>Democracy: A Journal of Ideas</i><br><p>"The book does an excellent job of covering the existing research regarding incentives and human behavior and synthesizing it into an understandable format.

Wilson, <i>Law Library Journal</i></p><br>&#x201c;<i>The Moral Economy</i> is a wonderful read for all those unfamiliar with the experimental tradition in economics. . . .

After a century of mass revolution, what is the fate of this elite art? Richard Kraus explores the relationship beween politics and the art of writing in China today to explicate the complex relationship between tradition and modernity in Chinese culture. His study draws upon a wide range of sources, from political documents, memoirs, and interviews with Chinese intellectuals to art exhibitions and television melodramas.<br><br>Mao Zedong and other Communist leaders gave calligraphy a revolutionary role, believing that their beloved art reflected the luster of authoritative words and deeds. Calligraphy was joined with new propagandistic mass media to become less a private art and more a public performance. It provided politically engaged citizens with subtle cues to changing power relationships in the People's Republic.<br><br>Claiming neither that the Communists obliterated traditional culture nor that revolution failed to relieve the burden of China's past, this study subtly examines the changing uses of tradition in a modernizing society.</p><p>"In Kraus's hands, the study of calligraphy becomes a metaphor for a much wider topic&#x2015;the persistence of traditionalism in modern China. That traditionalism is obvious to anyone who has even a superficial knowledge of modern China; but it is vague and so diffuse that it is difficult to gain a satisfying intellectual comprehension of it. By focusing on a small aspect of that traditionalism&#x2015;but an aspect with deep metaphoorical resonance&#x2015;the author helps us to gain a more focused understanding of Chinese cultural life."&#x2015;Richard Madsen, author of <i>Morality and Power in a Chinese Village</i><b>Richard Curt Kraus</b> is Professor of Political Science at the University of Oregon. He is the author of <i>Class Conflict in Chinese Socialism</i> (Columbia 1981) and <i>Pianos and Politics in China</i> (Oxford 1989).</p><h2>Architecture and Structuralism: The Ordering of Space</h2><p>The Dutch Architect and writer Herman Hertzberger (born 1932) is internationally recognized for both his built work and his written work. His buildings (such as Centraal Beheer in Apeldoorn, built in 1972) and his publications (such as his widely translated <i>Lessons for Students in Architecture</i>) have inspired generations of architects and students. In this book, Hertzberger lays down the foundations of his architectural vision, attempting to formulate a clear definition of structuralism in architecture and making a case for the necessity of resolving the meaning of this often-misunderstood concept. "What I see as the real structuralism in architecture is a way of thinking that has far-reaching opportunities for the reuse of buildings, which can give a new impulse to the discussion about sustainability," Herzberger writes. "The possibility of users having a greater influence has revealed the blueprint for a more democratic architecture."</p><p></p><h2>Domestic Manners of the Americans (Oxford Worlds Classics)</h2><p><strong>'it appeared to me that the greatest and best feelings of the human heart were paralyzed by the relative positions of slave and owner'</strong><br><br>In <em>Domestic Manners of the Americans</em> Frances Trollope recounts her travels through America between 1827 and 1830, describing her voyage up the Mississippi from New Orleans, a two-year stay in Cincinnati, and a subsequent tour of Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A transatlantic best-seller on publication in 1832, its forthright criticisms of American manners encompassed spitting, religious extremism, ladies' dress, the relentless pursuit of money, and the unequal treatment of women, slaves, and Native Americans. Witty, satiric, and hugely entertaining, Trollope also had a serious purpose in warning her compatriots of the consequences of democratic freedoms at a time of great social change in England. Deploring slavery and the hypocrisy that sanctioned it, she fuelled abolitionist debate on both sides of the Atlantic and so impressed Mark Twain that fifty years later he considered her book to be the most accurate portrait of American life in the nineteenth century.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years<strong> Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>Frances Trollope presents an engaging account of her visit to the United States during 1827-1831 in this two-volume travelogue. Published in 1832, it records her often outspoken views on many aspects of nineteenth-century American society. The immediacy of her impressions will arouse the curiosity of readers today.Richly informative on American manners and morals in the early ninteenth century, this famous travel account also reveals much about the contrast between British and American culture.</p><h2>Art After Philosophy and After: Collected Writing, 1966-1990</h2><p>Joseph Kosuth&#39;s writings, like his installations, assert that art begins where mere physicality ends. The articles, statements, and interviews collected here, produced over a period of 24 years, range over philosophy of language, anthropology, Marxism, and linguistics to discover the common principles that inform representation while negotiating the complex debates about art. Kosuth was one of the first to record the basic ideas and the role of ideas in the avant-garde of the 1970s and 1980s. Rooted in Freud, Wittgenstein, and French theory, his work investigates the linguistic nature of art propositions and the role of social, institutional, psychological, and ethnological context. His writings, like his visual productions, are radical formulations of the meaning of art itself. As a whole, they present a new definition of an expanded role and responsibility for the artist. Kosuth reevaluates the work of Marcel Duchamp and provides a theoretical agenda for institutional critique. He discusses the role of art in the future and its relationship to philosophy, attacks the return to painting of the late 1970s, and argues for the continued relevance of conceptualist ideas at times when other visual idioms have dominated the art world. Joseph Kosuth first received widespread notice at the Museum of Modern Art&#39;s &#34;Information&#34; exhibition and the Kunsthalle Bern&#39;s &#34;When Attitudes Become Form&#34; in the late 1960s. Today he is considered, along with Sol LeWitt, Edward Ruscha, Bruce Nauman, Dan Graham, Robert Morris and a handful of other artists, a founder of what has become known as conceptual art. His work appears in the permanent collections of many major museums.</p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>AHA : The Moments of Insight That Shape Our World</h2><p>Great ideas often develop gradually after studying a problem at length--but not always. Sometimes, an insight hits like a bolt from the blue. For Archimedes, clarity struck while he was taking a bath. For Gustav Mahler, it came as the blades of his oars touched the water. And for Albert Einstein, it emerged while he was talking to a friend. Why do these moments of insight strike so suddenly? Why do they so often come to us when we are focused on something completely unrelated? And when great ideas "come to" us, where do they come from? <br><br>In <em>Aha!: The Moments of Insight that Shape Our World</em>, philosopher William B. Irvine, author of <em>A Guide to the Good Life </em>and <em>On Desire</em>, explores these epiphanies, from the minor insights that strike us all daily, to the major realizations that alter the course of history. Focusing on aha moments as they take place in five different domains--religion, morality, science, math, and art--Irvine provides case studies that shed light on the different ways epiphanies happen in the different domains, and on their differing social impact. Along the way, he describes some of the great aha moments in history, from ancient times to the present day.<br><br>We like to think that our greatest thoughts are the product of our conscious mind. Irvine demonstrates, though, that it is our unconscious mind that is the source of our most significant insights, and that the role the conscious mind plays in eliciting these insights is to try, unsuccessfully, to solve certain problems. Only if the conscious mind is willing to do this--and thereby experience considerable frustration--is the unconscious mind likely to reward it with a breakthrough insight-that the conscious mind will then take credit for.<br><br>Irvine explores not only the neuroscience of aha moments but also their personal and social ramifications. How does a person respond to having a breakthrough insight that goes against a dominant paradigm? And how does the world respond when she shares that insight? Irvine shows that in many cases, what is most remarkable about those who have had the great insights of human history is not their but their courage and perseverance in fighting for the world to accept those insights.<br><br><em>Aha!</em> is a must-read for cognitive scientists, intellectual historians, philosophers, and anyone who has ever been blown away by the ideas that enlighten us when we least expect it.<br></p><p><br><strong>William B. Irvine</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. He describes himself as a twenty-first century Stoic and is author of <em>On Desire: Why We Want What We Want</em>; A<em> Guide to the Good Life: the Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</em>; and <em>A Slap in the Face: Why Insults Hurt--And</em> <em>Why They Shouldn't</em>.<br><br>"<em>Aha!</em> is a remarkable work of insight into how the mind really works. So many of our thoughts and ideas are not the product of deliberative rational computation, but instead seem to bubble up from where we know not, spontaneous creations that we are only now beginning to study. William Irvine spans the spectrum of human cognition in many areas of life, and does so in a highly readable narrative. I had many aha moments myself while reading this book!" --Michael Shermer, Publisher of <em>Skeptic</em> magazine, monthly columnist for <em>Scientific American</em>, author of <em>The Believing Brain</em> and <em>The Moral Arc</em><p></p><br>"In this fascinating, instructive book, William Irvine explores the various conditions and methods by which exceptional people have invited revelation, solved problems, or simply stumbled onto life-changing discoveries and insights. As he traces individuals' paths toward epiphanies large and small, Irvine discusses the roles of cultural environment, genetics, brain function, and more. There is no single formula or blueprint for an 'aha' moment, he suggests, though getting to that moment usually requires an open, curious mind. <em>Aha!</em> is a significant addition to the literature of invention, perception, and creativity." --Ann McCutchan, author of <em>The Muse That Sings</em><p></p><br>"With wide-ranging erudition and elegant style, <em>Aha!</em> is a fascinating study of the Eureka! phenomenon. In addition to asking how ideas happen, philosopher William B. Irvine delves deeply into how ideas transform us, individually and as a society, analyzing them from a variety of perspectives: psychological, evolutionary, sociological, and even political. Original, thought-provoking, and just a good read, this book is brimming with insights about moments of insight." --Elliot Samuel Paul, philosophy professor at Barnard College, Columbia University, and co-editor of <em>The Philosophy of</em> <em>Creativity</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Paine: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)</h2><p>Thomas Paine was arguably the single most influential political writer during the American and French Revolutions.

Gathering a decade&#x2019;s worth of posts from his blog, Rough Type, as well as his seminal essays, <em>Utopia Is Creepy</em> offers an alternative history of the digital age, chronicling its roller-coaster crazes and crashes, its blind triumphs, and its unintended consequences.</p><p>Carr&#x2019;s favorite targets are those zealots who believe so fervently in computers and data that they abandon common sense. Cheap digital tools do not make us all the next Fellini or Dylan. Social networks, diverting as they may be, are not vehicles for self-enlightenment. And &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and retweets are not going to elevate political discourse. When we expect technologies&#x2015;designed for profit&#x2015;to deliver a paradise of prosperity and convenience, we have forgotten ourselves. In response, Carr offers searching assessments of the future of work, the fate of reading, and the rise of artificial intelligence, challenging us to see our world anew.</p><p>In famous essays including &#x201c;Is Google Making Us Stupid?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Privacy,&#x201d; Carr dissects the logic behind Silicon Valley&#x2019;s &#x201c;liberation mythology,&#x201d; showing how technology has both enriched and imprisoned us&#x2015;often at the same time. Drawing on artists ranging from Walt Whitman to the Clash, while weaving in the latest findings from science and sociology, <em>Utopia Is Creepy</em> compels us to question the technological momentum that has trapped us in its flow. &#x201c;Resistance is never futile,&#x201d; argues Carr, and this book delivers the proof.</p></p><p>Nicholas Carr is the author of <i>The Shallows,</i> a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and <i>The Glass Cage</i>, among other books.

These melodramatic programs&#x2014;like soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts&#x2014;have been shown on television in Egypt for more than thirty years. In this book, Lila Abu-Lughod examines the shifting politics of these serials and the way their contents both reflect and seek to direct the changing course of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in this Middle Eastern nation.<br> <br> Representing a decade's worth of research, <i>Dramas of Nationhood</i> makes a case for the importance of studying television to answer larger questions about culture, power, and modern self-fashionings. Abu-Lughod explores the elements of developmentalist ideology and the visions of national progress that once dominated Egyptian television&#x2014;now experiencing a crisis.

It deals with the most gripping question in public life: "What is the right thing to do?" In <strong>Public Service Ethics: Individual and Institutional Responsibilities</strong>, James Bowman and Jonathan West examine individual-centered and organization-focused ethics, applying ideas and ideals from both to contemporary dilemmas.&nbsp; The authors take on controversial issues&#x2015;from whistle blowing incidents to corruption expos�s&#x2015;to explain how they arise and suggest what can be done about them. They start with the conceptual tools students need to evaluate an ethical dilemma, then analyze individual decision making strategies, and go on to assess institutional ethics programs. The emphasis is not only on the "how to," but also on the "why." The ultimate goal is to bolster students&#x2019; confidence and prepare them for the ethical problems they will face in the future, by equipping them with the conceptual frameworks and context to approach thorny questions and behave ethically.</p><p><p><b>James S. Bowman</b> is a professor of public administration at the Askew School of Public Administration and Policy, Florida State University. Noted for this work in ethics and human resource management, Dr. Bowman is author of over 100 journal articles and book chapters, as well as editor of six anthologies. He is co-author of <i>The Professional Edge: Competencies in Public Service</i> (2nd ed., Sharpe, 2010) and <i>Public Service Ethics: Individual and Institutional Responsibilities</i> (CQ Press, 2015). For nearly two decades, he served as editor-in-chief of <i>Public Integrity</i>, a journal owned by the American Society for Public Administration. A past National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration Fellow, as well as a Kellogg Foundation Fellow, he has experience in the military, civil service, and business.</p><p><i>Public Service Ethics:</i> <i>Individual and Institutional Responsibilities</i> is superior to other ethics texts I&#x2019;ve used -- I was hooked from the opening pages. Bowman and West do an admirable job of both building a coherent picture of ethical public management and providing students with a robust toolkit for making ethical decisions in a variety of settings. The authors thoroughly cover the essential topics and problems in public service ethics, and bring the theories and techniques of ethical management into sharp focus through compelling practical examples. Students&nbsp; are given ample opportunities to apply concepts and lessons from the text through a variety of well-developed exercises; case studies that illustrate real ethical problems confronting public managers bring the book&#x2019;s material to life. With its rich substantive content, current examples, and lively writing, this text is a compelling read and a welcome new development for public service ethics.</p> Author: Aaron Wachhaus<br><br><p><i>Public Service Ethics: Individual and Institutional Responsibilities</i> is a fabulous book. The overall coverage is terrific, especially in response to new challenges in public service. Bowman and West combine contemporary and timely research, issues, examples, and case studies; yet they also convey an awareness of the enduring ethical dilemmas at the heart of public service. The book has a nice blend of the theory and history of public service ethics, and includes practical strategies that will be very helpful to students as they build their way to an individualized approach to the challenges they face in their careers.&nbsp;A groundbreaking text.</p> Author: Kate Forhan<br><br><p>Bowman and West&#x2019;s<i> Public Service Ethics: Individual and Institutional Responsibilities</i> speaks directly to the ethical issues faced by public sector managers. The book fits amazingly well with the way I teach ethics. The authors make a compelling argument for the study of ethics and effectively integrate their ideas throughout the book. The writing is lively and engaging, and will appeal to students and working professionals because it is not pretentious and pious&#x2015;as are some works on the subject of ethics. The book&#x2019;s many strengths may be found in its well written exercises and study questions. This text encourages&nbsp;students to become reflective scholars, which fits hand-in-glove with my teaching style.<b></b></p> Author: Ramona Ortega-Liston<br><br><em>Public Service Ethics: Individual and Institutional Responsibilities </em>is a pleasure to read, and provides appropriately balanced coverage of the topic. Bowman and West&#x2019;s argument is persuasive, and the logical organization of their text clearly and effectively communicates the way public managers can use their understanding of personal ethics and societal ethics to build organizational ethics. I especially like their discussion of how "macro," "meso," and "micro" levels of ethical analysis relate to each other. Readers will find the book&#x2019;s analytic approach both engaging and illuminating. Author: Dan Feldman<br><br><p><i>Public Service Ethics:</i> <i>Individual and Institutional Responsibilities </i>will serve as a great resource for my students. Bowman and West&#x2019;s approach to ethics is well developed and balanced, and evokes both reflection and analysis. The text is particularly strong on presenting empirical evidence of ethics practices and how effective or ineffective they are; and for buttressing pro and con positions on ethical issues. Discussions of moral development theory, corruption, and the ethics of elected and appointed officials -- topics that are usually not well developed in other ethics texts -- are especially valuable.&nbsp; The authors also offer many useful analytic tools and methods for engaging in ethical analysis, with numerous real-world examples and cases that effectively illustrate the key points in each chapter.<b>&nbsp;</b> </p> Author: Richard Green<br><br>This book represents a considerable accomplishment in a field where there??? are inevitably many loose ends and where new ethical problems increasingly confront public of??ficials. It provides a coherent and integrated relationship between theory and practice, a framework for analysis, and illustrations of the way in which analytical tools may be employed to deal with ethical dilemmas. It makes a signi????ficant new contribution to the study of administrative ethics.???

But what if certain games were something more than this, providing not only outlets for entertainment but a means for creative expression, instruments for conceptual thinking, or tools for social change? In <i>Critical Play</i>, artist and game designer Mary Flanagan examines alternative games&#x2015;games that challenge the accepted norms embedded within the gaming industry&#x2015;and argues that games designed by artists and activists are reshaping everyday game culture. </p><p>Flanagan provides a lively historical context for critical play through twentieth-century art movements, connecting subversive game design to subversive art: her examples of &#x201c;playing house&#x201d; include Dadaist puppet shows and <i>The Sims</i>. She looks at artists' alternative computer-based games and explores games for change, considering the way activist concerns&#x2015;including worldwide poverty and AIDS&#x2015;can be incorporated into game design.</p><p>Arguing that this kind of conscious practice&#x2015;which now constitutes the avant-garde of the computer game medium&#x2015;can inspire new working methods for designers, Flanagan offers a model for designing that will encourage the subversion of popular gaming tropes through new styles of game making, and proposes a theory of alternate game design that focuses on the reworking of contemporary popular game practices.</p></p><p>Mary Flanagan is Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities, Director of the Tiltfactor game research laboratory, and Professor in the Department of Film and Media Studies at Dartmouth College.

(Science Essentials, 7)</h2><p><p>In <i>The Medea Hypothesis</i>, renowned paleontologist Peter Ward proposes a revolutionary and provocative vision of life's relationship with the Earth's biosphere--one that has frightening implications for our future, yet also offers hope. Using the latest discoveries from the geological record, he argues that life might be its own worst enemy. This stands in stark contrast to James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis--the idea that life sustains habitable conditions on Earth. In answer to Gaia, which draws on the idea of the "good mother" who nurtures life, Ward invokes Medea, the mythical mother who killed her own children. Could life by its very nature threaten its own existence?</p><br><p> According to the Medea hypothesis, it does. Ward demonstrates that all but one of the mass extinctions that have struck Earth were caused by life itself. He looks at our planet's history in a new way, revealing an Earth that is witnessing an alarming decline of diversity and biomass--a decline brought on by life's own "biocidal" tendencies. And the Medea hypothesis applies not just to our planet--its dire prognosis extends to all potential life in the universe. Yet life on Earth doesn't have to be lethal. Ward shows why, but warns that our time is running out.</p><br><p> Breathtaking in scope, <i>The Medea Hypothesis</i> is certain to arouse fierce debate and radically transform our worldview. It serves as an urgent challenge to all of us to think in new ways if we hope to save ourselves from ourselves.</p></p><p><p>"A provocative look at the history of our living planet. Ward offers a distinct perspective and argues strongly that the only intelligent choice is to manage ourselves and the environment.<i>The Medea Hypothesis</i> will cause anyone who cares about the environment to think differently."<b>--Thomas E. Lovejoy, president of the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment</b></p><p>"This book casts the environmental debate in a completely new and important light. Ward demolishes the comfortable illusion that nature will take care of us if we just let it. To survive in the long term, the Earth needs a management team--we humans have to take up the job."<b>--Chris McKay, NASA Ames Research Center</b></p><p>"<i>The Medea Hypothesis</i> is provocative, extremely well-written, and very convincing."<b>--Simon A. Levin, Princeton University</b></p><p>"For those comforted by the notion of a benevolent Gaia working to sustain life on the planet, Ward's Medea is a nightmare, one that has recurred many times in Earth's history and is coming again soon, unless we take action to combat the self-annihilating tendency of the biosphere."<b>--Lee R. Kump, coauthor of <i>Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming</i></b></p><p>"Serious and well written, <i>The Medea Hypothesis</i> is sure to generate controversy among the experts. I read it over a weekend and could hardly put it aside until I finished it."<b>--Francisco J. Ayala, University of California, Irvine</b></p><p>"This is an important and significant contribution to the fields of geobiology and astrobiology because it offers a startling new interpretation of the nature of Darwinian evolution. Ward's conclusion is both troubling and provocative: life may be its own worst enemy. Like James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis, Ward's Medea hypothesis is likely to be debated for the next thirty years."<b>--Joseph L. Kirschvink, California Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"A provocative rethinking of the coevolution of life and its environment. Peter Ward mounts a sustained critique of optimizing/homeostatic Gaia, providing a lucid set of examples of significant positive feedbacks arising from life. This book will have a strong heuristic impact on future research."<b>--David Schwartzman, author of <i>Life, Temperature, and the Earth</i></b></p><b>Peter Ward</b>'s many books include the highly acclaimed <i>Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe</i> and <i>Under a Green Sky</i> (Collins).

The 11th edition of the &#34;Guide to Reference Books&#34; brings together most useful research sources from early printing to contemporary electronic publishing. With nearly 16,000 entries, this edition organises and describes important reference works for today&#39;s research and scholarship, including carefully selected items from every part of the world and imprints up to the start of 1994. Items from previous editions have been dropped if they failed to meet the general test of utility. Unlike earlier editions, the 11th includes an abundance of electronic resources - CD-ROM, online databases, and laser discs; it adds more extensive guidance on use of the reference works, with expert opinions on their merits and shortcomings. The &#34;Guide&#34; contains approximately 2000 pages of text. Its wealth of information has been prepared by more than 50 reference librarians practicing in research libaries from Harvard to the University of California. Contributors were encouraged to bring their experience to bear on the usefulness of selections. Each entry describes the work and its special features, often comparing similar or competing works. This index to the world of research is systematic in its vast coverage, organisation and indexing. Access is by the familiar topical arrangement and the huge single-alphabet index, in which authors, titles and subjects are distinguished typographically. More than 400 pages in length, the index also includes titles and authors appearing in the annotations. &#34;GRB&#34; coverage focuses on scholarly research; but, general reference needs that come up in research libraries - family health, for example - are also addressed. While concentrating on English-language sources, the &#34;Guide&#34; encompasses works in dozens of languages (with entries romanised). In general, works cited are of the type that endure in reference publishing and scholarly research.</p><p>The long-awaited eleventh edition of this reference standard has finally appeared. This edition adheres to guidelines developed by a panel of advisers: no dramatic changes in scope or arrangement, in one volume and listing primarily print sources, number of titles similar to the tenth edition, and with a higher proportion of titles that support diverse viewpoints. These guidelines were followed, mostly for the better, but the one-volume format is for the worse. It has been said that the editor of the ninth edition was warned that it should be no larger than the Manhattan phone book. Unfortunately, the eleventh edition weighs more than any phone book.<p>The basic arrangement of the volume resembles editions since the eighth with only slight changes--a new general-interest area was created for such basic sources as <i>Encyclopedia of Associations</i>, a general section was created for the humanities, travel and tourism were moved to geography, and geographic areas are now listed by landmass rather than alphabetically. Some annotations were reprinted from the tenth edition (1986) and its supplement (1992); many new annotations provide criticism or evaluative statements.</p><p>The 15,875 titles were chosen by 50 general-reference and subject-specialist librarians from major universities across the U.S. Five referees suggested additions and deletions in the five broad subject areas. Since it was thought that science had been underrepresented in the past, titles in that area were increased by 14 percent. For example, a number of new titles are listed in the climatology, plastics, genetics, and medicine sections. There is a significant increase in titles on women in specific countries and additional listings for many African and Asian countries. The majority of entries are for print resources, but a number of machine-readable titles are included, distinguished by a bullet. For example, FRANCIS and PASCAL, the electronic services that replaced the <i>Bulletin Signaletique</i>, are described in detail. There is a section for electronic encyclopedias, with reference to Britannica Online. But though there continues to be extensive coverage of national and international bibliographies, there is no listing for OCLC's WorldCat or RLG's RLIN, both of which now dwarf the <i>National Union Catalog</i>. Also, many electronic tools are now available from more than one vendor. It is probably not reasonable to expect <i>GRB</i> to list all the online or CD-ROM vendors of an index, but users should be aware that the Wilson indexes, for example, are available from FirstSearch as well as Wilsonline.</p><p>Although the number of titles is only slightly more than in the tenth edition, the index is larger, almost one-quarter of the total volume. This is commendable. There are index entries for most works mentioned in the notes or annotations and also a number of <i>see</i> and <i>see also</i> references. The major criticism of the eleventh edition is its lack of currency. The introduction is dated June_ 1995, but there are few 1994 titles listed. For example, the thirteenth rather than the fourteen edition of the <i>Reader's Adviser</i> is cited. Important exclusions are the <i>Academic Index</i>, <i>National Newspaper Index</i> and the <i>McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology on CD-ROM</i>. The CD-ROM version of <i>GRB</i> that had been advertised has been canceled because of lack of advance orders. An online version through a vendor would be a useful format for libraries.</p><p>Editor Balay refers to this bible of reference sources as having "respect approaching reverence." This edition certainly measures up to the <i>GRB</i> tradition of a comprehensive listing of reference sources in many languages. Even with a price of $275 (compared with $50 for the tenth edition and $100 for the supplement), it remains an important acquisition for reference work in research libraries. For smaller libraries, a new edition of <i>Reference Sources for Small and Medium-Sized Libraries</i> will be available in early 1997. <i></i></p></p><h2>The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst</h2><p><p><b>The Sailor's Classics library introduces a new generation of readers to the best books ever written about small boats under sail</b></p> <p>In the autumn of 1968, Donald Crowhurst set sail from England to participate in the first single-handed nonstop around-the-world sailboat race.

White, William Golding, John Barth, Thomas McGuane, Geoffrey Wolff&#x2014;along with a multitude of sailors who wrote, from Slocum and John Voss to Tristan Jones and the father-son team of Daniel and David Hays. After nearly two hundred years, the literature of small-boat voyaging under sail is enormous, and every publishing season sees more additions to the list. </p><p>It is the function of The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics to recognize and celebrate the relatively small number of truly important books in this library. Some have been chosen because the voyages they describe are themselves of unignorable merit; some because the sheer brilliance of their writing demands their inclusion. Most combine in equal parts serious nautical interest with literary excellence. </p><p>As general editor of the series, I am always trying to keep in mind the bookshelves on my own 35-foot ketch. A proper ship&#x2019;s library isn&#x2019;t restricted to books with boats in them, of course; I wouldn&#x2019;t happily set sail for more than a day or two without novels by Dickens, Trollope, Evelyn Waugh, and Saul Bellow, and poetry by Pope, Keats, Tennyson, Hardy, Philip Larkin, and Robert Lowell. The big question is which small-boat voyages can stand up in such exalted literary company? Not very many is the honest answer, and half the function of an editor is to know what he must reject. The books that won&#x2019;t figure in the series are as important as those that will. </p><p>We won&#x2019;t be publishing quaint curiosities. Period charm does not make a classic, and though I have a soft spot for, say, Nathaniel Bishop&#x2019;s Four Months in a Sneak Box (1879), and an even softer one for Maurice Griffiths&#x2019; The Magic of the Swatchways (1932), they won&#x2019;t be found in The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics. Nor will the many salty &#x201c;yarns&#x201d; full of the faded yo-ho-ho of generations past. Whimsical accounts of family vacations afloat (the obligatory adventure with the dog and the dinghy...) will be left to gather dust in peace. So will all those melancholy solo voyages in which the writers go to sea in order to discover themselves. </p><p>There remain the books whose vigor has not dimmed with the passage of time, whose voice is as alive and meaningful now as it was on their first publication&#x2014;the books that should be essential reading for every literate sailor. No. 2 in the series is Richard Maury&#x2019;s The Saga of Cimba, first published in 1939; No. 4 is The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst by Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall, first published in 1971. They are perfect examples of what I mean: one a loving close-up portrait of the sea in all its moods, written by a master mariner with an astonishing literary gift; the other a study, by two journalists, of a man who lost touch with reality during the course of the first singlehanded round-the-world yacht race. Each&#x2014;in its very different way&#x2014;is an indispensable book. Each contributes an important thread to the larger pattern in the carpet, which is the great, various, and intricate design of the literature of small-boat sailing. </p><p>The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics will surprise our readers with its richness and complexity. Since Homer&#x2019;s Odyssey, the voyage has supplied one of the classic forms in literature&#x2014;both as a grand metaphor for life itself in the long passage from birth to death, and as a sequence of tests and adventures. Equally, the boat (and especially the small boat) has long stood as a symbol of selfhood&#x2014;a fragile ark bearing the journeying soul to its destination. Hilaire Belloc put the matter beautifully in The Cruise of the Nona: </p><p> The cruising of a boat here and there is very much what happens to the soul of a man in a larger way... We are granted great visions, we suffer intolerable tediums, we come to no end of the business, we are lonely out of sight of England, we make astonishing landfalls&#x2014;and the whole rigmarole leads us along no whither, and yet is alive with discovery, emotion, adventure, peril and repose. Those five nouns should be emblazoned above The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics: it is from the interweaving of discovery, emotion, adventure, peril, and repose that the pattern of sailing literature is made, and we shall do our best to honor each and every one in our selection of the best books ever written about life aboard small boats at sea. Jonathan Raban<br> Series Editor<br> March 2001</p><p>"A masterpiece."--<i>The New Yorker</i> </p><p>In the autumn of 1968, Donald Crowhurst set out from England in an improbable-looking plywood trimaran to compete in the first singlehanded nonstop round-the-world sailboat race. Although his previous sailing experience was limited, his boat unready, and the electronic gadgetry of his own design unfinished and untested, Crowhurst had managed to persuade first an affluent backer, then the contest judges, and, finally, England's media to regard him as a serious contender. Sailing south through the Atlantic, he radioed reports of record-breaking sailing performances. In the South Atlantic he announced that low battery power would require him to maintain radio silence through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Eleven weeks later he broke his silence to tell the world he had rounded Cape Horn and was sailing north for England, the elapsed-time leader of the race. Then tragedy struck. Eight months after his departure, Crowhurst's <i>Teignmouth Electron</i> was discovered adrift in an eerie mid-Atlantic calm, intact but without her skipper. </p><p>In this tour de force of investigative journalism, Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall tell the story of Donald Crowhurst's ill-fated voyage. Working from Crowhurst's recovered logs and diaries, the authors reconstruct the events leading up to his disappearance: his first few weeks at sea and his growing distrust of his boat; his attempts to come to grips with imminent failure; his decision to hide out midocean in the South Atlantic, away from the shipping lanes, faking a round-the-world journey; and his final, desperate escape from discovery as the would-be perpetrator of one of the biggest hoaxes in sailing history. </p><p>From in-depth interviews with Crowhurst's family and friends and telling excerpts from his logbooks, Tomalin and Hall develop a tale of tragic self-delusion and public deception, a haunting portrait of a complex, deeply troubled man and his journey into the heart of darkness. </p><p>With its first publication in 1970, <i>The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst</i> became an instant classic. Sir Francis Chichester, whose record-setting 1967 circumnavigation inspired the 1968 - 69 round-the-world race, called it "the sea drama of the century." Robin Knox-Johnston, the winner of the race, has called it "one of the great classic sea stories." You won't be able to put it down, and you won't be able to forget it. </p><p>A Daring Hoax and the Man It Destroyed </p><p>July 1969. After a voyage of 240 days, Donald Crowhurst was less than two weeks from a triumphant return to England, the apparent victor in the first nonstop singlehanded around-the-world sailboat race. All England was preparing for his arrival. But then he disappeared. His boat was found, sailing sedately, undisturbed--but he was not on it. From the logbooks he left behind, Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall reconstructed this extraordinary, deeply unsettling tale. . . . </p><p>"A virtuoso demonstration of the soul's anatomy."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i> </p><p>"One of the most moving and disturbing books I have ever read.

We are on the leading edge of a Smart Machine Age led by artificial intelligence that will be as transformative for us as the Industrial Revolution was for our ancestors. Smart machines will take over millions of jobs in manufacturing, office work, the service sector, the professions, you name it. Not only can they know more data and analyze it faster than any mere human, say Edward Hess and Katherine Ludwig, but smart machines are free of the emotional, psychological, and cultural baggage that so often mars human thinking. <br><br> So we can&#x2019;t beat &#x2019;em and we can&#x2019;t join &#x2019;em. To stay relevant, we have to play a different game. Hess and Ludwig offer us that game plan. We need to excel at critical, creative, and innovative thinking and at genuinely engaging with others&#x2014;things machines can&#x2019;t do well. The key is to change our definition of what it means to be smart. Hess and Ludwig call it being NewSmart. In this extraordinarily timely book, they offer detailed guidance for developing NewSmart attitudes and four critical behaviors that will help us adapt to the new reality. <br><br> The crucial mindset underlying NewSmart is humility&#x2014;not self-effacement but an accurate self-appraisal: acknowledging you can&#x2019;t have all the answers, remaining open to new ideas, and committing yourself to lifelong learning. Drawing on extensive multidisciplinary research, Hess and Ludwig emphasize that the key to success in this new era is not to be more like the machines but to excel at the best of what makes us human.</p><p>Hello, I am ed - thank you for your interest in our book. This book is the most important book of my 12 books. It is a book about human excellence - how we human beings can thrive and flourish in the coming Smart Machine Age by excelling at doing well what technology won&#39;t be able to do well at least for the near future. We are on the leading-edge of a technology revolution that likely will be as disruptive for us as the Industrial Revolution was for our ancestors. We as a society and many of us as individuals are not ready for what&#39;s coming. In the next 10 years, technology will take over millions of jobs including professional jobs. We humans will be in a frantic footrace to stay relevant. Our answer lies within what makes us unique as humans - our ability to think differently than machines and our ability to engage emotionally with other humans. Based on science and examples, our book offers you a new story about human excellence called NewSmart - a new mindset with four key NewSmart Behaviors -that will help you excel at thinking and engaging with others differently and better than the smart machines will be able to do. Our book is a &#34;how to&#34; stay relevant book with self-assessments and tools. We invite you to join us on the journey to human excellence.Edward D.

Artists working in this highly traditional medium draw from a wealth of ancient themes, but must resolve them within contemporary Chinese culture. In <i>Fresh Ink</i>, ten of China's leading contemporary artists engage directly with the past by creating ten new works in response to older masterpieces, ranging from classical Chinese scrolls to a scholar's rock to a drip painting by Jackson Pollock. Their personal visions reflect diverse concerns and influences, whether Xu Bing's play on the absurdly monumental, Qin Feng's system of communicative signs, or the keen eye for society evident in the work of Li Jin, Yu Hong and Liu Xiaodong. An adventurous pairing of contemporary artworks with their forbears, <i>Fresh Ink</i> blurs the boundaries between traditional and contemporary, East and West.</p><p></p><h2>Robinson Crusoe (Classics Illustrated)</h2><p>Daniel Defoe&#39;s story of the shipwrecked hero and his lonely adventure.
